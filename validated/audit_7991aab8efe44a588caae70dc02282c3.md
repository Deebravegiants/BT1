No vulnerability found for this question.

**Reasoning:** The external report concerns a global, cyclable submit/withdraw *limit* counter in `CorePrimary.sol` (e.g., a shared daily/period cap decremented on submit and incremented on withdraw, or vice versa) that an attacker can exhaust by repeatedly cycling submit+withdraw, denying the action to other users.

I searched the in-scope NEAR core-contracts production code — `staking-pool/src` [1](#0-0) , `staking-pool/src/lib.rs` [2](#0-1) , `staking-pool-factory/src/lib.rs` [3](#0-2) , `whitelist/src/lib.rs` [4](#0-3) , and `lockup/src` callback flows [5](#0-4)  — and found no analogous shared, mutable rate-limit or cap state that is decremented/incremented by deposit/stake/unstake/withdraw actions and could be drained or exhausted by an unprivileged user cycling actions to lock out others.

Deposit, stake, unstake, and withdraw in `staking-pool/src/internal.rs` operate strictly on per-account balances and shares (`account.unstaked`, `account.stake_shares`) with no shared limit counter that gets consumed [6](#0-5) . The withdrawal delay is a per-account `unstaked_available_epoch_height` gate, not a shared resource [7](#0-6) . `staking-pool-factory`'s only "limiting" check is that a pool account ID cannot already exist, which doesn't create a drainable global limit for other users [8](#0-7) . `whitelist` and `multisig` similarly have no shared consumable submit/withdraw quota; `multisig`'s `active_requests_limit` is a per-key/per-member counter that only affects the caller's own pending requests, not other users' ability to act [9](#0-8) .

Since there is no reachable, shared limit state in core-contracts analogous to the aspida `CorePrimary.sol` submit/withdraw cap, there is no matching root cause to report.
