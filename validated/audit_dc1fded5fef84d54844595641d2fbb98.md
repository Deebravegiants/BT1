### Title
Accrual arithmetic overflow permanently freezes oversized high-utilization markets - (File: `common/src/rates/simulate.rs`)

### Summary
An unprivileged user can create a sufficiently large supplied and borrowed market position within admitted RAY-domain caps, then allow interest to compound until either stored scaled balance multiplied by its index exceeds `i128::MAX`. [1](#0-0)  The overflow occurs inside `accrue_step`, before either borrow-index cap can stop growth, and is propagated by `interest::global_sync` through every pool mutation that loads a synced market. [2](#0-1)  Once crossed, `update_indexes`, `withdraw`, `repay`, liquidation-related `seize_positions`, `recapitalize`, and other market mutations panic before their recovery logic runs. [3](#0-2) 

### Finding Description
Each market mutation loads `Cache` through `synced_market`, which calls `interest::global_sync` before executing the requested operation. [3](#0-2)  `global_sync` invokes `accrue_step`, which computes `scaled_to_original(borrowed, borrow_index)` and `scaled_to_original(supplied, supply_index)` before checking rates, updating indexes, or clamping `new_borrow_index` to `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`. [1](#0-0)  `scaled_to_original` performs the product in the RAY domain and therefore panics when `scaled * index` no longer fits `i128`. [4](#0-3) 

The index ceiling does not prevent this condition because `update_borrow_index` multiplies `old_index` by the interest factor and only then compares the product with `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`. [5](#0-4)  More importantly, the old scaled balances are unscaled before the new index is calculated, so an oversized market can cross the value ceiling while its index remains below the cap. [6](#0-5) 

The regression test demonstrates the reachable state with `1e27` raw units of an 18-decimal asset, `98%` utilization, and repeated yearly `update_indexes` calls. [7](#0-6)  The test verifies that `update_indexes` eventually returns `MathOverflow` while `borrow_index` remains below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`. [8](#0-7)  It then verifies that both withdrawal and repayment fail with the same error because they accrue first. [9](#0-8) 

### Impact Explanation
This causes permanent freezing of all funds in the affected market rather than merely rejecting one malformed call. [9](#0-8)  Suppliers cannot withdraw because `withdraw::accounting` invokes `ops::load_leg`, which syncs the market before resolving or burning shares. [10](#0-9)  Borrowers cannot repay because `repay::accounting` likewise invokes `ops::load_leg` before resolving debt. [11](#0-10)  `seize_positions` cannot socialize bad debt or seize deposits because it calls `ops::synced_market` before its borrow-side write-down and debt burn. [12](#0-11)  Even `recapitalize` cannot apply cash because it calls `ops::renewed_market`, which performs the same accrual before calculating the backing shortfall. [13](#0-12) 

The controller exposes permissionless `update_indexes`, `repay`, `liquidate`, `clean_bad_debt`, and `recapitalize` entrypoints, so there is no alternate permissionless path that skips the failing accrual. [14](#0-13) [15](#0-14) 

### Likelihood Explanation
The attack requires market scale: the scaled RAY balance must be large enough that later index growth pushes the value product past `i128::MAX`. [16](#0-15)  The admitted cap ceiling is approximately `i128::MAX / 10^(27-decimals)`, while accrued market values are not separately guaranteed to fit the RAY domain. [16](#0-15)  A single funded attacker can supply the debt asset, post separate collateral, borrow up to the market’s permitted utilization, and then use the permissionless `update_indexes` entrypoint as time passes. [17](#0-16) [18](#0-17) 

The required capital and sustained high utilization make this Medium rather than Critical or High. [19](#0-18)  The repository’s own long-horizon test nevertheless proves the state transition is reachable under configured caps and parameters, rather than requiring corrupted storage or privileged state mutation. [20](#0-19) 

### Recommendation
Accrual should detect the value-domain ceiling before unscaling the current balances and enter a bounded terminal state instead of panicking. [6](#0-5)  For example, cap or mark the market’s borrow index at `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` when the next unscale would overflow, while preserving a path for ceiling-rounded repayment, withdrawal, liquidation, and bad-debt settlement. [5](#0-4)  At minimum, add a pre-accrual `scaled_to_original` saturation check with explicit market-level handling; a saturating result alone would be unsafe for repayments because it could understate debt. [4](#0-3)  The configured cap should also be lowered to keep `scaled_position * MAX_INDEX` within `i128`, accounting for revenue-share growth across chunked accrual. [16](#0-15) 

### Proof of Concept
The existing deterministic test establishes the full path:

1. Create an 18-decimal market and lift its admitted cap to `max_cap_for_decimals(18)`. [21](#0-20) 
2. Supply `1_000_000_000 * 10^18` base units through the normal `supply` path. [22](#0-21) 
3. Post collateral and borrow `98%` of that market through the normal `borrow` path. [23](#0-22) 
4. Advance ledger time in yearly intervals and call permissionless `update_indexes` after each interval. [24](#0-23) 
5. `update_indexes` eventually fails with `MathOverflow` while the stored borrow index is still below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`. [8](#0-7) 
6. Subsequent `withdraw` and `repay` calls also fail with `MathOverflow` because both load the market through the accrual path. [9](#0-8)

| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
