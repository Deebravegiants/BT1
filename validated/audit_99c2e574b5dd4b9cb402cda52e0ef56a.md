### Title
Unchecked RAY value overflow during interest accrual permanently freezes a market - (File: common/src/rates/simulate.rs)

### Summary
The interest-accrual path multiplies stored scaled balances by live indexes before applying the borrow-index ceiling. Once a sufficiently large market’s `borrowed * borrow_index` or `supplied * supply_index` exceeds `i128::MAX`, every subsequent accrual panics with `MathOverflow` before any protective cap or mutation can run. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

### Finding Description
`accrue_step` first converts `borrowed` and `supplied` shares back to RAY asset values using `scaled_to_original`, which delegates to fallible `Ray::mul` and panics on an unrepresentable result. [4](#0-3) [2](#0-1) [5](#0-4) 

The borrow index is clamped only after its own multiplication succeeds, so the `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` ceiling does not prevent the earlier scaled-balance multiplication from overflowing. [3](#0-2) 

Every pool market operation loads its cache and runs `global_sync` before supply, borrow, withdraw, repay, liquidation settlement, revenue claim, or recapitalization state changes are applied. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) 

An unprivileged user can create this state through `Controller::supply` and `Controller::borrow`; once ledger time advances far enough for index growth to push a scaled balance past the RAY value domain, `Controller::update_indexes` and all later market-touching calls revert at accrual. [10](#0-9) [11](#0-10) 

The repository’s integration test demonstrates the exact cliff: after a billion-unit market reaches high utilization, the next index update raises `MATH_OVERFLOW`, the index remains below its configured ceiling, and both withdrawal and repayment fail. [12](#0-11) 

### Impact Explanation
The vulnerable market becomes unable to process ordinary exits, repayments, liquidations, index updates, or corrective supply operations because each operation accrues first and then panics. [6](#0-5) [12](#0-11) 

This permanently freezes user deposits and blocks repayment or liquidation of outstanding debt in that market unless privileged intervention can change the execution path outside the normal market flow. [13](#0-12) 

### Likelihood Explanation
The state is reachable without privileged calls: a user supplies a very large position in the target market and creates high utilization through a normally authorized borrow on sufficiently collateralized accounts. [10](#0-9) [14](#0-13) 

The precondition is economically expensive and market-parameter dependent because caps, available token supply, collateral requirements, and utilization limits constrain how close a deployed market can get to the representable RAY ceiling. [15](#0-14) 

Once those quantities are admitted, no attacker action is needed beyond waiting for accrual and calling permissionless `update_indexes` or any market operation. [7](#0-6) [16](#0-15) 

### Recommendation
Before computing `scaled_to_original`, compare `borrowed` and `supplied` against `i128::MAX / borrow_index` and `i128::MAX / supply_index`, then clamp the relevant index or debt/supply value through an explicitly defined ceiling path instead of allowing multiplication to trap. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

Alternatively, use a checked/saturating multiplication for utilization and reward calculations and ensure index caps engage before any unrepresentable market total can be formed. [17](#0-16) 

### Proof of Concept
The existing harness test constructs the reachable sequence: lift caps to the admitted domain, supply `1_000_000_000 * 10^18` units of `BIG18`, borrow 98% of it against `COL`, advance ledger time in one-year chunks, and call `update_indexes`. [18](#0-17) 

The call fails with `MATH_OVERFLOW` while `borrow_index < MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`; subsequent `withdraw` and `repay` calls also fail with `MATH_OVERFLOW`, proving that the overflow occurs in accrual before either mutation can execute. [19](#0-18)

| Bound | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
