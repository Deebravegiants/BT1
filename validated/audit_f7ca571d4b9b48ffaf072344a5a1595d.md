### Title
Pending Withdrawal rsETH Accrues Rewards That Are Systematically Captured by Remaining Holders via Fixed-Rate Payout Cap - (File: contracts/LRTWithdrawalManager.sol)

---

### Summary

When `initiateWithdrawal()` is called, the rsETH is transferred to `LRTWithdrawalManager` but **not burned**. The `expectedAssetAmount` is fixed at the current oracle rate. During the withdrawal delay (up to 8 days), the pending rsETH remains in `totalSupply()` and participates in reward-driven price appreciation. When `unlockQueue()` is called, `_calculatePayoutAmount()` caps the payout at `min(expectedAssetAmount, currentReturn)`. If rewards have accrued and `currentReturn > expectedAssetAmount`, the withdrawing user receives the old (lower) rate and the accrued yield is silently redistributed to remaining rsETH holders.

---

### Finding Description

**Step 1 — Rate fixed at request time, rsETH not burned.**

In `initiateWithdrawal()`, the rsETH is pulled from the user and held in the contract: [1](#0-0) 

`expectedAssetAmount` is computed once using the live oracle price and stored in the `WithdrawalRequest` struct. The rsETH is **not burned here**; it remains outstanding in `totalSupply()`.

**Step 2 — Pending rsETH participates in reward accrual.**

`LRTOracle._updateRsETHPrice()` computes the new price as:

```
newRsETHPrice = (totalETHInProtocol - protocolFeeInETH) / rsethSupply
``` [2](#0-1) 

`rsethSupply` is `totalSupply()`, which includes the rsETH sitting in `LRTWithdrawalManager`. When EigenLayer rewards arrive and `totalETHInProtocol` grows, `rsETHPrice` rises across the entire outstanding supply — including the pending withdrawal rsETH.

**Step 3 — Payout is capped at the stale request-time rate.**

When the operator calls `unlockQueue()`, `_calculatePayoutAmount()` enforces:

```solidity
uint256 currentReturn = (request.rsETHUnstaked * rsETHPrice) / assetPrice;
return (request.expectedAssetAmount < currentReturn) ? request.expectedAssetAmount : currentReturn;
``` [3](#0-2) 

If rewards have accrued during the delay, `currentReturn > expectedAssetAmount`. The function returns `expectedAssetAmount` — the stale, lower value. The rsETH is then burned at line 305: [4](#0-3) 

`assetsCommitted[asset]` is reduced by the full `expectedAssetAmount`, but only `payoutAmount` (= `expectedAssetAmount`) is redeemed from the vault. The delta between `currentReturn` and `expectedAssetAmount` — the yield that accrued to the withdrawing user's rsETH — remains in the vault and is absorbed by remaining rsETH holders through the next price update.

**Asymmetry:** The withdrawing user bears full downside (if `rsETHPrice` drops, they receive `currentReturn < expectedAssetAmount`) but receives none of the upside (if `rsETHPrice` rises, they are capped at `expectedAssetAmount`). This is structurally one-sided.

---

### Impact Explanation

**High — Theft of unclaimed yield.**

Every withdrawing user loses the yield that accrued to their rsETH during the withdrawal delay window (default: 8 days, maximum: 16 days). That yield is not returned to them; it is redistributed to remaining rsETH holders via the price mechanism. The magnitude scales with: (1) the size of the pending withdrawal, (2) the reward rate during the delay, and (3) the length of the delay. For a large withdrawal during a high-reward period, the loss can be material.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

**High.** EigenLayer generates staking rewards continuously. Over an 8-day withdrawal delay, it is near-certain that `updateRSETHPrice()` will be called at least once with a higher `totalETHInProtocol`, raising `rsETHPrice` above the level at which `expectedAssetAmount` was fixed. Every user who calls `initiateWithdrawal()` during normal protocol operation is affected.

---

### Recommendation

Choose one of two consistent designs:

1. **Burn rsETH at `initiateWithdrawal()` time.** Remove the burned rsETH from `totalSupply()` immediately so it no longer participates in reward accrual. The fixed `expectedAssetAmount` then correctly represents the user's entitlement with no accrual gap.

2. **Recalculate payout at `unlockQueue()` time without a cap.** Do not store `expectedAssetAmount` as a ceiling. Instead, compute the payout entirely from the current oracle prices at unlock time, so the withdrawing user receives the rate that reflects all rewards (and losses) that accrued during the delay — consistent with how remaining holders are treated.

Option 1 matches the mETH design critique in the external report (burn at request time). Option 2 aligns settlement with the latest protocol state.

### Proof of Concept

1. Alice holds 100 rsETH. `rsETHPrice = 1.00 ETH/rsETH`, `assetPrice(ETH) = 1e18`. She calls `initiateWithdrawal(ETH, 100e18)`.
   - `expectedAssetAmount = 100e18 * 1e18 / 1e18 = 100 ETH` stored in request.
   - 100 rsETH transferred to `LRTWithdrawalManager`, **not burned**. `totalSupply()` still includes Alice's 100 rsETH.

2. Over the next 8 days, EigenLayer rewards of 10 ETH arrive. `updateRSETHPrice()` is called. `totalETHInProtocol` increases by 10 ETH. With 1000 rsETH total supply (Alice's 100 included), `rsETHPrice` rises to `1.01 ETH/rsETH`.

3. Operator calls `unlockQueue(ETH, ...)`. `_calculatePayoutAmount()` computes:
   - `currentReturn = 100e18 * 1.01e18 / 1e18 = 101 ETH`
   - `min(100 ETH, 101 ETH) = 100 ETH` → Alice receives 100 ETH.

4. Alice's 100 rsETH is burned. The 1 ETH of rewards that accrued to her rsETH during the delay remains in the vault. It is absorbed by the remaining 900 rsETH holders on the next `updateRSETHPrice()` call.

5. Alice loses 1 ETH of yield she was entitled to. The loss scales linearly with withdrawal size and reward rate over the delay window.
