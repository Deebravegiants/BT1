### Title
Attacker-controlled swap route can add unauthorized token transfers to the caller’s signed authorization tree - ([File: contracts/controller/src/strategies/swap.rs])

### Summary
`multiply`, `swap_debt`, `swap_collateral`, and `repay_debt_with_collateral` accept caller-supplied route bytes and forward them to the configured router without constraining the contracts invoked by that route. A route can therefore place attacker-controlled pool code beneath the caller’s `require_auth` tree. If a simulated poisoned route is signed, that code can execute additional token transfers from the caller’s wallet, unrelated to the lending position and unbounded by the routed amount or final health checks.

### Finding Description
`swap_collateral(caller, account_id, current, amount, new, swap)` exposes `swap` as an opaque `Bytes` parameter and passes it into `process_swap_collateral` [1](#0-0) . The implementation authenticates the account owner or delegate, withdraws the requested collateral, and forwards the same bytes to the swap helper [2](#0-1) .

`swap_tokens` authorizes only the exact protocol input transfer from the controller to the configured router, then calls `execute_strategy(controller, amount_in, swap)` under the flash guard [3](#0-2) . The authorization helper creates one exact nested token-transfer authorization and permits no sub-invocations from that controller grant [4](#0-3) .

That bound does not constrain code invoked by the route itself. The threat model explicitly records that the router calls pool and token addresses named by the payload without an allowlist, and that a transfer from the caller performed by that code appears as a child of the caller’s authorization entry [5](#0-4) . Thus, although the controller grants the router only the routed input, a malicious payload can expand the caller-signed authorization tree to include unrelated wallet transfers.

### Impact Explanation
This is theft of user funds. A victim can lose any wallet token for which the malicious route causes an authorization child to be recorded and signed, including assets never supplied to or listed by the lending protocol. The repository’s focused reproduction transfers an unrelated wallet token from Alice to the attacker while still producing the expected collateral output [6](#0-5) .

Neither the route minimum, positive measured output, nor final account-risk validation bounds this loss: those checks concern only the strategy input/output and resulting account position, not extra token calls executed under the caller’s signed authorization tree [7](#0-6) .

### Likelihood Explanation
An unprivileged attacker can deploy the malicious pool and encode it into a route supplied through a quoting interface, strategy builder, or prompt-injected transaction construction path. The attack succeeds when the victim signs the authorization tree produced by simulation without decoding or rejecting its extra child invocation. The focused test shows that an honest route needs no child authorization, the rogue transfer is rejected when not signed, and signing the simulation-produced poisoned tree makes the theft succeed [8](#0-7) .

### Recommendation
Do not expose route-selected venue calls beneath an end-user root authorization without an enforcing allowlist. Governance should maintain accepted venue/pool implementations, and route execution should reject unapproved pool addresses before any venue call. Independently, transaction builders and wallets must decode the complete route and reject any caller authorization tree other than the exact expected token input transfer; controller clients should treat any additional child as fatal.

### Proof of Concept
1. Alice owns a debt-free account with supplied USDC and also holds an unrelated token that is not protocol collateral.
2. The attacker deploys a route-compatible pool whose `swap` function calls `token.transfer(alice, attacker, wallet_balance)`.
3. The attacker supplies a `swap_collateral` route naming that pool while preserving a fair `token_out` payment.
4. Alice calls:
   `swap_collateral(alice, account_id, usdc_hub_asset, 50_000_000_000, eth_hub_asset, malicious_route)`.
5. Simulation records `token.transfer(alice, attacker, wallet_balance)` beneath Alice’s controller authorization; if Alice signs that tree, the unrelated token moves to the attacker while the strategy still deposits the expected ETH output [6](#0-5) .
6. If Alice signs only the honest root-only tree, the host rejects the rogue transfer and rolls back the call; signing the poisoned tree is what completes the theft [9](#0-8) .

That bound covers the controller's own grant only. The router calls the pool
and token addresses its payload names and keeps no allowlist of them, so a
route can put third-party code on the call stack below the caller's
authorization. A token transfer that such code makes from the caller is
recorded by an honest simulation as a child of the caller's authorization
entry, and it executes if the caller signs that tree. The loss is then the
caller's wallet, not the routed amount, and neither the payload minimum nor the
final risk gate bounds it. An honest swap strategy gives the caller no child
entry, and a direct router swap gives exactly one input transfer. A client must
decode the route it signs and refuse an authorization tree with any other
child. The direct `execute_strategy` path has the same exposure for every swap
