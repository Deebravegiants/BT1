### Title
Accrued RAY-value overflow permanently freezes all pool operations for an overlarge market - (File: `common/src/rates/index.rs`)

### Summary
The pool computes accrued debt as `borrowed * new_borrow_index` and supplied value as `supplied * supply_index` in RAY-denominated `i128`. A market can contain valid balances and indexes whose scaled value exceeds `i128::MAX`, at which point `Ray::mul` panics with `MathOverflow` during the mandatory pre-operation accrual. An unprivileged user can create the market state through `supply`, `borrow`, and `update_indexes`; afterward, `withdraw`, `repay`, `liquidate`, and every other operation that loads that market fails before it can reduce the oversized value.

### Finding Description
`accrue_step` first converts aggregate `borrowed` and `supplied` shares into present RAY values with `scaled_to_original`, then computes interest using the newly compounded borrow index. `scaled_to_original` calls `Ray::mul`, which returns `MathOverflow` when the result does not fit `i128`; the result cap applies even though the intermediate multiplication uses `I256`.

The two later calls in `calculate_supplier_rewards` repeat the same value calculation for the old and new borrow indexes, and `update_supply_index` does it for supplied shares. None of these paths can skip or bound an already-overlarge market value. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) 

Every pool mutation loads the market and calls `interest::global_sync` before applying its operation. `global_sync` repeatedly calls `accrue_chunk`, which calls the same `accrue_step`; therefore an arithmetic panic prevents the requested repayment, withdrawal, liquidation, or other market mutation from being reached. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) 

The controller exposes the relevant user path directly: `supply` accepts `Vec<(HubAssetKey, i128)>`, `borrow` accepts `Vec<(HubAssetKey, i128)>`, and permissionless `update_indexes` accepts `Vec<HubAssetKey>` and forwards it to the pool. The pool is controller-owned, but authorization by the controller does not change the user-controlled balances and elapsed time that trigger the overflow. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9) [11](#0-10) [12](#0-11) 

### Impact Explanation
The impact is permanent freezing of user funds and protocol insolvency containment failure: suppliers cannot withdraw, borrowers cannot repay, liquidators cannot liquidate, and recapitalization or revenue claims touching the same market also accrue first and fail. Because time cannot move backward and the index is monotonically nondecreasing, the market cannot naturally recover once its RAY value exceeds `i128::MAX`; recovery would require code or state intervention outside the listed unprivileged paths. [13](#0-12) [14](#0-13) [15](#0-14) 

The repository's own long-horizon test demonstrates that a market with a one-billion-token 18-decimal deposit and 98% utilization crosses the RAY-value ceiling before the borrow-index cap, then fails `update_indexes`, `withdraw`, and `repay` with `MATH_OVERFLOW`. [16](#0-15) 

### Likelihood Explanation
Likelihood is conditional on a market admitting very large value and sustaining high borrow utilization, so it is not reachable in a normally small or low-utilization market. It requires no privileged action at exploitation time, however: once governance has listed such a market and caps permit the book, ordinary users can provide the supply and borrow the debt, after which ordinary passage of time triggers the overflow.

The limit is reached below the stated `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` cap because the checked quantity is `scaled_shares * index / RAY`; a sufficiently large `scaled_shares` makes the product exceed `i128` while the index is still far below `10^36`. The checked conversion is therefore a real reachable panic rather than a defense that bounds index growth. [17](#0-16) [14](#0-13) [18](#0-17) 

### Recommendation
Make accrual total-value calculations saturation-aware or able to reduce obligations before revaluing the whole market. In particular, avoid panicking on `borrowed * index` and `supplied * index` during `accrue_step`: detect representability first and clamp the index or process a bounded accrual that leaves subsequent repayments and withdrawals executable. Market caps should also be enforced against projected post-accrual RAY value, not only current token input, because admission limits based solely on `10^(27 - decimals)` do not reserve headroom for index growth. [19](#0-18) [20](#0-19) 

### Proof of Concept
Use an 18-decimal asset market with a high-utilization rate curve and caps that admit the position:

1. Call `controller.supply(caller=BOB, account_id=0, spoke_id=S, assets=[(BIG18, 1_000_000_000 * 10^18)])`.
2. Give a borrower enough separate collateral, then call `controller.borrow(caller=ALICE, account_id=A, borrows=[(BIG18, 980_000_000 * 10^18)], to=None)`.
3. Advance ledger time until the sustained borrow rate compounds `borrow_index` sufficiently that `borrowed * borrow_index / RAY > i128::MAX`.
4. Call `controller.update_indexes(caller=EVE, assets=[BIG18])`; `global_sync` → `accrue_step` → `scaled_to_original` panics with `MathOverflow`.
5. Subsequent `controller.withdraw`, `controller.repay`, or `controller.liquidate` calls involving `BIG18` hit the same accrual before their position-reduction logic and revert.

This sequence is implemented by the repository test `a_whale_market_at_sustained_high_utilization_hits_the_ray_value_ceiling_before_the_index_cap`, which observes `MATH_OVERFLOW` from `try_update_indexes_for`, `try_withdraw_raw`, and `try_repay` while `borrow_index < MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`.
