### Title
RAY-value overflow in interest accrual permanently freezes a market - (File: common/src/rates/index.rs)

### Summary
Scaled debt is multiplied by the borrow index during every accrual without a total-value ceiling, so a sufficiently large market can reach `i128::MAX` before `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` caps index growth. Once that happens, every operation that syncs the market reverts, freezing withdrawals, repayments, liquidations, and subsequent index updates. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

### Finding Description
`accrue_step` computes `borrowed * borrow_index` and `supplied * supply_index` before calculating utilization and the next interest step. [3](#0-2) 

`calculate_supplier_rewards` then multiplies the same scaled debt by both the old and new borrow indexes; although `update_borrow_index` caps the index itself, the multiplication occurs after the new index is calculated and debt valuation can overflow earlier than the cap. [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) 

The pool's shared `synced_market` helper calls `interest::global_sync` before normal mutation legs, and the explicit `update_indexes` path does the same for each requested market. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) 

The in-tree regression test demonstrates the cliff: a 1-billion-token, 18-decimal market at 98% utilization eventually fails `update_indexes` with `MATH_OVERFLOW`, below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, and both withdrawal and repayment then fail with the same error. [8](#0-7) 

### Impact Explanation
All suppliers in the affected `(hub_id, asset)` market lose access to their pool claims because withdrawals synchronize the market before burning shares. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9) 

Borrowers cannot reduce exposure through `repay`, and liquidators cannot rescue unhealthy accounts through liquidation because those flows also reach the same accrual path through the controller's pool calls. [11](#0-10) [12](#0-11) 

This is permanent freezing of user funds rather than a transient pause: the stored scaled totals remain unchanged, and every later accrual repeats the overflowing multiplication. [5](#0-4) [7](#0-6) 

### Likelihood Explanation
The attacker needs a market configured with enough supply and borrow capacity to make `scaled_debt * borrow_index` approach `i128::MAX`, plus enough collateral to borrow a large fraction of that market. [13](#0-12) 

The documented numeric bound is approximately 170 billion whole-token equivalents before index scaling, and the regression uses a 1-billion-token, 18-decimal market at 98% utilization to reach the boundary through accrual. [14](#0-13) [15](#0-14) 

The attack is therefore capital-intensive and conditional on deployed caps and interest-rate configuration, but it is reachable through ordinary `supply`, `borrow`, and permissionless `update_indexes` calls once those market conditions exist. [16](#0-15) [17](#0-16) 

### Recommendation
Bound market state by RAY-denominated value, not only by token cap and index ceilings. Before admitting supply or debt, check that `scaled_amount * current_index` and the projected post-accrual values fit safely in `i128`, and reject entries that would leave the market unable to accrue. [18](#0-17) [4](#0-3) 

For an already saturated market, provide a recovery path that clamps accrual at the first representable total-value boundary or permits repayment, withdrawal, liquidation, and recapitalization without recomputing the overflowing growth step. [19](#0-18) [2](#0-1) 

### Proof of Concept
The existing test establishes the complete sequence: create the large 18-decimal market, supply `BILLION * 10^18`, supply sufficient separate collateral, borrow 98% of the market, advance ledger time, and call `update_indexes` until `MATH_OVERFLOW`. [20](#0-19) 

```rust
let principal = BILLION * 10i128.pow(18);
t.supply_raw(BOB, "BIG18", principal);
let debt = principal / 100 * 98;
t.supply_raw(ALICE, "COL", BILLION * 10_000_000 * 3);
t.borrow_raw(ALICE, "BIG18", debt);

loop {
    t.advance_time(YEAR_SECS);
    if t.try_update_indexes_for(&["BIG18"]).is_err() {
        break;
    }
}
```
The code above is from `tests/test-harness/tests/controller/large_positions_and_long_horizons.rs`. [21](#0-20) 

After the overflow, `last.borrow_index < MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, while both `withdraw` and `repay` fail with `MATH_OVERFLOW`, proving the index ceiling does not prevent the permanent market freeze. [22](#0-21)

| Bound | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
