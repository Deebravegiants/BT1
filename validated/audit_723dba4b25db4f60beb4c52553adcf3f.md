### Title
Whale-scale debt makes interest accrual overflow and permanently freezes a market - (File: `common/src/rates/index.rs`)

### Summary
A market carrying sufficiently large scaled debt can reach a state where every subsequent operation reverts with `MathOverflow` before its debt can be reduced. `update_indexes`, `borrow`, `withdraw`, `repay`, liquidation legs, and other pool mutations all accrue interest before applying the requested operation. Once `borrowed * borrow_index` exceeds the `i128` range, `calculate_supplier_rewards` panics, so the market never commits a new `last_timestamp` and remains frozen.

### Finding Description
The controller exposes permissionless `supply`, `borrow`, `repay`, `update_indexes`, and liquidation entrypoints. A whale can supply collateral and borrow a very large amount through `borrow(caller, account_id, borrows, to)`. [1](#0-0) 

Pool market operations load `Cache`, then call `interest::global_sync` before mutating state. `global_sync` repeatedly calls `accrue_chunk`, which updates the borrow index and revenue through `accrue_step`. [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

Inside accrual, `calculate_supplier_rewards` computes both `borrowed.mul(old_borrow_index)` and `borrowed.mul(new_borrow_index)`. These multiplications use checked fixed-point arithmetic and panic with `MathOverflow` when the debt value exceeds `i128::MAX`. [4](#0-3) 

The index ceiling does not prevent this condition: the index may still be below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` while the total scaled debt value already exceeds the representable RAY range. The repository's regression test demonstrates this exact cliff and shows that both `update_indexes` and subsequent `withdraw`/`repay` calls fail with `MATH_OVERFLOW`. [5](#0-4) 

### Impact Explanation
All suppliers in the affected market lose the ability to withdraw, borrowers cannot repay, and liquidators cannot execute liquidation legs for that market because each pool leg synchronizes the same market before performing the requested mutation. [6](#0-5) 

Repay specifically calls `load_leg` before resolving or burning debt, and withdraw does the same before burning supply. Consequently, even a transaction intended to reduce the overflowing `borrowed` balance cannot execute after the accrual cliff is reached. [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) 

This is a permanent freezing of funds for that market, not merely a failed call. Because accrual fails before `mark_accrued` or `commit`, no partial accrual is stored and every later call retries the same overflowing calculation. [9](#0-8) [10](#0-9) 

### Likelihood Explanation
The attack is reachable by an unprivileged funded address through ordinary `supply` and `borrow` calls, subject to configured caps, liquidity, collateral requirements, and asset decimals. The amount required is extreme, which reduces practical likelihood, but the relevant RAY capacity is finite and the repository explicitly demonstrates the state with a large 18-decimal market. [11](#0-10) [12](#0-11) [13](#0-12) 

Once the overlarge book exists, triggering the condition requires only waiting until accrued debt value crosses the `i128` boundary; any signed caller can then call `update_indexes(caller, assets)` and hit the panic. [14](#0-13) 

### Recommendation
Do not let interest accrual panic after the debt book has exceeded the representable value domain.

- Compute old/new debt values and their delta in `I256`, then bound or safely convert the final values.
- Add a market-size invariant that rejects supply/borrow entries which could allow `borrowed * MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` or a conservative projected intermediate index to exceed `i128::MAX`.
- If saturation is intentional, saturate the accrued debt/index at a recoverable boundary rather than panicking, while ensuring withdrawals and repayments can still operate.
- Add an explicit catch-up path for oversized markets that commits bounded accrual without requiring the full old-to-new debt product to fit in `i128`.
- Keep the existing whale-market regression as a release test and extend it to prove that `repay`, `withdraw`, and liquidation remain callable at maximum admitted book size.

### Proof of Concept
The repository already contains a deterministic proof of the freeze:

1. Create an 18-decimal market using the steep `xlm_curve`, raise caps, and supply `1_000_000_000 * 10^18` base units.
2. Borrow approximately 98% of that market through `borrow`.
3. Advance time in yearly steps and call `update_indexes`.
4. `update_indexes` eventually returns `MathOverflow` while `borrow_index` remains below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`.
5. A subsequent one-unit `withdraw` and a `repay` both return the same `MathOverflow`, proving that exits and debt reduction are blocked by the same accrual failure. [15](#0-14)

| Bound | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
