### Title
Unvalidated swap-route pool can steal unrelated wallet tokens through the caller’s authorization tree - (File: `contracts/controller/src/strategies/swap.rs`)

### Summary
Controller strategy calls accept caller-supplied `swap` bytes and forward them to the configured swap aggregator without inspecting the pool addresses encoded in the route. [1](#0-0)  The route’s `assets` registry can contain arbitrary pool and token addresses, and a venue adapter invokes the selected pool contract directly. [2](#0-1)  A malicious pool invoked below `swap_collateral` can request a token transfer from the caller; Soroban records that transfer as a child of the caller’s signed authorization tree and executes it if the caller signs the poisoned tree. [3](#0-2) 

### Finding Description
`swap_collateral(caller, account_id, current, amount, new, swap)` is callable by an account owner or delegate and passes the raw `swap` argument into the strategy implementation. [1](#0-0)  After checking the caller and account authorization, `process_swap_collateral` passes that route to `withdraw_and_swap_from_supply`. [4](#0-3) 

`swap_tokens` authorizes only the controller’s exact input-token transfer to the configured router and then calls `router.execute_strategy(controller, amount_in, swap)`. [5](#0-4)  Its subsequent checks only reject excessive measured input spending and require positive measured output; they do not inspect route pool identities or prevent route code from adding a caller-authorized sub-invocation. [6](#0-5) 

The route format lets each instruction select its pool through `idx_a` in the caller-controlled `assets` registry. [7](#0-6)  For a Soroswap-labelled hop, the router invokes `get_reserves` on that supplied pool address, sends the input to it, and invokes its `swap` entrypoint. [8](#0-7)  There is no production-code pool allowlist on this path; the router trusts whatever contract address the payload names. [9](#0-8) 

A rogue pool can therefore emulate the expected pool interface, return enough output to satisfy `min_out` and the controller’s positive-output check, and additionally call `unrelated_token.transfer(victim, attacker, amount)`. [10](#0-9)  The included test shows this extra transfer being recorded as a child of the victim’s `swap_collateral` authorization and draining the victim’s entire unrelated wallet-token balance. [11](#0-10) 

### Impact Explanation
A successful route can steal tokens from the swap caller that were never supplied to the lending protocol and were not part of the declared swap input. [11](#0-10)  The amount is bounded only by the victim’s wallet balance and the authorization tree they sign; neither the route’s `min_out` nor the controller’s account-risk checks bounds this unrelated transfer. [9](#0-8)  This is direct theft of user funds rather than poor swap execution, because the malicious pool transfers a token unrelated to the strategy’s declared input or output. [12](#0-11) 

### Likelihood Explanation
An unprivileged attacker can deploy the rogue pool and construct a valid route naming it, without privileged protocol access or leaked keys. [2](#0-1)  Exploitation requires a victim or client to sign the authorization tree containing the malicious child transfer, so it depends on users signing simulated route transactions without independently validating every child authorization. [13](#0-12)  The exposed attack surface includes `swap_collateral`, `swap_debt`, `multiply`, and `repay_debt_with_collateral`, all of which accept caller-provided route bytes. [14](#0-13) 

### Recommendation
Restrict routes to governance-approved immutable pool contract addresses for each supported venue, or add another on-chain pool registry that the router consults before invoking a hop. [15](#0-14)  Reject any payload whose pool address is not registered for the selected venue instead of relying on clients to detect poisoned authorization trees. [9](#0-8)  Wallets and transaction builders should still display the complete Soroban authorization tree and reject unexpected child contract invocations before signing. [16](#0-15) 

### Proof of Concept
1. The attacker deploys a contract exposing `get_reserves` and `swap`, configured with the victim address, an unrelated token contract, the attacker recipient, and the amount to steal. [10](#0-9) 
2. The attacker creates route bytes whose `assets` registry places that contract in the pool index and whose instruction references it as `idx_a`. [7](#0-6) 
3. The victim calls `swap_collateral(victim, account_id, current, amount, new, malicious_swap)`. [1](#0-0) 
4. The controller passes the route to the configured router and authorizes only its own collateral-input transfer; it does not validate the route’s pool identity. [5](#0-4) 
5. The router invokes the attacker-controlled pool, which performs the normal-looking swap response and also calls `unrelated_token.transfer(victim, attacker, amount)`. [8](#0-7) 
6. Simulation records the theft as a child of the victim’s `swap_collateral` authorization, and signing that tree transfers the victim’s unrelated wallet tokens to the attacker while still crediting valid swap output. [17](#0-16)

```markdown
That bound covers the controller's own grant only. The router calls the pool
and token addresses its payload names and keeps no allowlist of them, so a
route can put third-party code on the call stack below the caller's
authorization. A token transfer that such code makes from the caller is
recorded by an honest simulation as a child of the caller's authorization
entry, and it executes if the caller signs that tree. The loss is then the
caller's wallet, not the routed amount, and neither the payload minimum nor the
final risk gate bounds it. An honest swap strategy gives the caller no child
entry, and a direct router swap gives exactly one input transfer. A client must
decode the route it signs and refuse an authorization tree with any other
child. The direct `execute_strategy` path has the same exposure for every swap
```
