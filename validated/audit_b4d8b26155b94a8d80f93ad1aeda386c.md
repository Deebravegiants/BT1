### Title
Unchecked market-value overflow during accrual permanently freezes a large high-utilization market - (File: common/src/rates/simulate.rs)

### Summary
`accrue_step` converts total scaled debt and supply back to `i128` RAY values before applying the borrow-index cap. Once a sufficiently large market's debt value exceeds the `i128` domain, `scaled_to_original` panics with `MathOverflow`, and every subsequent accrual attempt reverts. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

### Finding Description
An attacker can create this state through ordinary calls: `supply` a very large amount in a listed high-decimal market, collateralize a controlled account in another market, and `borrow` most of that liquidity. [4](#0-3)  Any address can later trigger accrual with `update_indexes(caller, assets)`, which forwards the selected market to the pool. [5](#0-4) [6](#0-5) 

The pool's `global_sync` runs `accrue_chunk` for every elapsed interval and marks the market accrued only after all chunks complete. [7](#0-6)  `accrue_chunk` calls `accrue_step` before storing the capped indexes, while `accrue_step` first computes `borrowed * borrow_index` and `supplied * supply_index` through `scaled_to_original`. [8](#0-7) [1](#0-0)  If either product's quotient exceeds `i128::MAX`, `mul_div_half_up` returns `None` and panics with `GenericError::MathOverflow`. [9](#0-8) 

This can occur before `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` is reached: the existing harness test demonstrates an 18-decimal market where an index above roughly 170x makes the debt-value conversion overflow while the stored index remains below the cap. [10](#0-9) 

### Impact Explanation
The failed conversion permanently wedges the market because the accrual is the first step in the relevant mutations, not an optional maintenance operation. [7](#0-6) [11](#0-10)  The harness confirms that after the accrual failure, both `withdraw` and `repay` continue to fail with `MathOverflow`. [12](#0-11) 

Supplier withdrawals, borrower repayments, and liquidation-dependent recovery for that market are therefore frozen, matching the protocol's permanent-freezing impact class rather than a single-call denial of service. [13](#0-12) [11](#0-10) 

### Likelihood Explanation
The exploit requires an admitted market and caps large enough for scaled debt to approach the `i128` boundary, sustained high utilization, and enough ledger time for the borrow index to cross the overflow point. [14](#0-13) [15](#0-14)  Those conditions are economically extreme, but they use only caller-authorized `supply`, `borrow`, and permissionless `update_indexes`; no privileged call, malformed cross-contract dependency, or oracle failure is required after the market configuration exists. [4](#0-3) [6](#0-5) 

### Recommendation
Refactor accrual so market totals are never converted into an `i128` `Ray` before the overflow boundary is handled. Compute utilization and accrued-value deltas with widened `I256` arithmetic or checked/saturating conversion, apply the configured index ceiling before any potentially overflowing unscale where semantics permit, and enforce a market-level scaled-debt bound tied to the maximum index. Add a regression test proving that `update_indexes`, `withdraw`, `repay`, and `liquidate` remain callable when `borrowed * borrow_index / RAY` would exceed `i128::MAX`. [16](#0-15) [17](#0-16) [11](#0-10) 

### Proof of Concept
The repository already contains a deterministic reproduction in `a_whale_market_at_sustained_high_utilization_hits_the_ray_value_ceiling_before_the_index_cap`. [18](#0-17) 

1. Configure an 18-decimal market and caps that admit `1_000_000_000 * 10^18` base units of supply. [19](#0-18) 
2. Supply that amount, fund separate collateral, and borrow 98% of the supplied market into an attacker-controlled account. [20](#0-19) 
3. Advance the ledger and call `update_indexes(caller, [BIG18])`; the call eventually fails inside accrual with `MathOverflow`. [21](#0-20) 
4. Observe that the stored borrow index is still below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, while withdrawal and repayment both continue to revert. [22](#0-21)

| Bound | Consequence |
|---|---|
| Asset decimals 0..=18 | Exact token-to-RAY upscaling. Below 3: collateral only, no flash loans, no liquidation fee, its account's only supply position, at least 2 whole units while in debt |
| Both indexes initially RAY; ceiling 10^36 | 10^9 times initial index; protocol constants |
| Supply-index floor 10^24 | At most 1,000 times the shares minted at index one for the same deposit |
| Borrow APR maximum 2 RAY | 200% annual rate; not a bound on balance growth alone |
| Token-to-RAY input maximum `i128::MAX / 10^(27-d)` | About 170.14 billion whole tokens, before other limits |
| Deposit conversion at the supply-index floor | About 170.14 million whole tokens before scaled-share overflow |

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
