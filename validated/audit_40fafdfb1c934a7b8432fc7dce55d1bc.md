### Title
Index-scaled debt overflow permanently freezes a large market - ([File: common/src/rates/scaling.rs](common/src/rates/scaling.rs))

### Summary

A sufficiently large market can grow its RAY-denominated debt value beyond `i128::MAX` long before `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY` is reached. Every subsequent market operation performs interest accrual first, so the resulting `MathOverflow` permanently blocks repayment, withdrawal, liquidation, index updates, and other accesses to that market. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

### Finding Description

Pool positions store RAY-scaled share quantities, while current value is computed by multiplying those shares by the live index through `scaled_to_original`, which delegates directly to checked `Ray` multiplication. [4](#0-3)  During accrual, the pool repeatedly evaluates utilization and interest from `borrowed * borrow_index` and `supplied * supply_index`. [5](#0-4) [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) 

For an 18-decimal token, one billion whole tokens is `10^27` token units and approximately `10^36` RAY-scaled shares at an initial index of one RAY. Once the borrow index exceeds roughly `170 × RAY`, multiplying `10^36` by that index produces a RAY value above `i128::MAX`. The repository’s own long-horizon test demonstrates that this occurs before the `10^9`-times borrow-index ceiling can engage. [3](#0-2) [2](#0-1) 

`update_indexes` is permissionless and forwards the caller-selected market list to the pool. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8)  Once the first accrual crossing the numeric boundary reverts, the market timestamp is not advanced, so all later calls encounter the same overflowing historical accrual. [10](#0-9) [5](#0-4) 

### Impact Explanation

This is a permanent freezing-of-funds condition for every participant in the affected market. Suppliers cannot withdraw because withdrawal loads a synced market before resolving or burning shares. [11](#0-10)  Borrowers and third parties cannot repay because repayment also loads a synced market before burning debt. [12](#0-11)  New borrows are blocked for the same reason, and liquidation-related pool legs cannot progress without first completing the same accrual path. [13](#0-12) [14](#0-13) 

The repository’s regression test explicitly verifies that after the overflow is reached, both `withdraw` and `repay` fail with `MATH_OVERFLOW`. [15](#0-14)  Because no smaller transaction can bypass `global_sync`, the failure is not resolved by reducing the requested repayment or withdrawal amount.

### Likelihood Explanation

The attack requires a market configuration whose supply and borrow caps admit a book large enough for `scaled_shares * index` to exceed the `i128` domain. It also requires sustained high utilization under an interest curve that can grow the index to roughly 170x before the configured borrow-index ceiling applies. [16](#0-15) [2](#0-1) 

A single unprivileged attacker can create two owned accounts through repeated `supply(..., account_id = 0, ...)` calls, use one account to provide the target-market liquidity and the other to provide collateral and borrow most of it, then invoke the permissionless `update_indexes` path as interest accrues. [17](#0-16) [18](#0-17) [8](#0-7)  The capital requirement is substantial, so this is configuration- and market-size-dependent rather than universally reachable, but the repository test shows the arithmetic boundary is reachable inside the supported domain.

### Recommendation

Use saturating or widened arithmetic for aggregate market-value calculations before the index ceiling is applied. In particular, `borrowed * borrow_index`, `supplied * supply_index`, and related accrual calculations should be evaluated in `i256`/`u256`, or explicitly saturated at `i128::MAX` before converting back to `i128`. [7](#0-6) [4](#0-3) 

Alternatively, cap configured supply and borrow amounts to a domain derived from `i128::MAX / MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, rather than only validating token-native caps. That bound should account for both supplied and borrowed scaled values, including revenue shares minted into total supply. [19](#0-18) [20](#0-19) 

### Proof of Concept

1. Configure or select a listed 18-decimal market using a steep borrow-rate curve and caps that admit at least one billion whole tokens. The repository’s stress market uses a 175% maximum borrow rate and 75% optimal utilization. [16](#0-15) 
2. Call `supply(attacker, 0, spoke_id, [(BIG18, 1_000_000_000 * 10^18)])` to create a liquidity account.
3. Call `supply(attacker, 0, spoke_id, [(COL, sufficient_collateral)])` to create a borrowing account.
4. Call `borrow(attacker, borrowing_account_id, [(BIG18, 980_000_000 * 10^18)], attacker)` to establish approximately 98% utilization. The test uses exactly these proportions and sufficient collateral. [21](#0-20) 
5. Periodically call the permissionless `update_indexes(attacker, [BIG18])`. Once the accrual calculation reaches a RAY value above `i128::MAX`, the call fails with `MathOverflow`. [8](#0-7) [10](#0-9) 
6. Subsequent calls to `repay`, `withdraw`, `borrow`, liquidation settlement, or `update_indexes` for the same market all load and sync the same market first and fail before any recovery action can reduce the scaled balances. [22](#0-21) [15](#0-14)
