### Title
Opaque route-selected contract code can abuse caller authorization to steal unrelated wallet assets - (File: contracts/controller/src/strategies/swap.rs)

### Summary
Controller strategies pass caller-supplied opaque swap bytes to the configured router. A route can name malicious third-party venue code; during execution, that code can request a token transfer from the strategy caller. The controller’s authorization only constrains the controller-funded input transfer—it does not prevent unrelated transfers from being attached to the caller’s authorized invocation tree. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

### Finding Description
`swap_tokens` snapshots the controller’s input and output balances, authorizes exactly `token_in.transfer(controller, router, amount_in)`, then calls `router.execute_strategy(controller, amount_in, swap)` with the caller-provided route. Those checks bound what the router can take from the controller, but they do not constrain what route-selected contracts may request from the account that authorized the original controller call. [3](#0-2) 

Soroban authorization is represented as a tree rooted at the caller-approved controller invocation. A transfer requested by descendant route code is recorded beneath that root and succeeds if the caller signs the poisoned tree produced by simulation. The harness demonstrates this using `swap_collateral(caller, account_id, collateral_asset, amount, debt_asset, swap)`: a malicious hop pool invokes `token.transfer(victim, attacker, amount)`, and simulation records that unrelated transfer under Alice’s `swap_collateral` authorization. [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) [6](#0-5) 

This is analogous to downloading an executable from an unauthenticated source: opaque routing data selects executable third-party code, while settlement checks validate only the expected token flows and not the code’s authorization side effects. [7](#0-6) 

### Impact Explanation
A victim who signs a simulated malicious route can lose arbitrary unrelated tokens held by the authorized account, beyond the collateral amount intentionally routed through the strategy. The harness demonstrates complete theft of a 77,770-unit wallet-token balance while the route still returns a valid strategy output, so the controller’s measured-output and final risk checks do not prevent the side theft. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) 

### Likelihood Explanation
An unprivileged attacker can deploy a malicious venue-compatible contract and cause the victim to submit a strategy whose route selects it, commonly through a malicious quote, UI, or copied route payload. The attack does require the victim to authorize the poisoned invocation tree; however, ordinary signing flows rely on simulated authorization data, and users commonly do not independently decode every nested token transfer. [10](#0-9) [11](#0-10) 

### Recommendation
Restrict route-selected venue/pool contracts to a governance-controlled allowlist of audited immutable deployments, or otherwise execute swaps only through adapters whose target contracts are known not to request user authorization. At minimum, wallets and quoting infrastructure must simulate, decode, and prominently reject authorization trees containing anything other than the expected controller root and exact input transfer. [12](#0-11) [1](#0-0) 

### Proof of Concept
The repository’s harness constructs a malicious `RogueHopPool` whose `swap` calls `token.transfer(victim, attacker, amount)`, then routes Alice’s `swap_collateral` through it. In recording mode, the theft appears as a child of Alice’s authorized controller invocation and transfers her entire unrelated wallet balance. [13](#0-12) [6](#0-5) 

In enforcing mode, the same route is rejected under an honest empty authorization tree but succeeds when Alice signs the tree containing the malicious transfer, proving that the protocol’s balance checks are bypassed by caller authorization rather than prevented by them. [10](#0-9)

final account passes its risk gates. Exposure is bounded by routed funds and
those gates, not by an independent controller slippage limit.

That bound covers the controller's own grant only. The router calls the pool
and token addresses its payload names and keeps no allowlist of them, so a
route can put third-party code on the call stack below the caller's
authorization. A token transfer that such code makes from the caller is
recorded by an honest simulation as a child of the caller's authorization
entry, and it executes if the caller signs that tree. The loss is then the
caller's wallet, not the routed amount, and neither the payload minimum nor the
final risk gate bounds it. An honest swap strategy gives the caller no child
entry, and a direct router swap gives exactly one input transfer. A client must
decode the route it signs and refuse an authorization tree with any other
child. The direct `execute_strategy` path has the same exposure for every swap
user.
