### Title
RAY debt-value overflow permanently freezes a market after accrual - ([File: common/src/rates/index.rs])

### Summary

A sufficiently large borrowed position can make the RAY-denominated aggregate debt exceed `i128::MAX` during interest accrual. Because every pool mutation synchronizes interest before performing the requested action, this unchecked semantic limit causes repayments, withdrawals, liquidations, revenue claims, and future index updates for that market to revert permanently.

### Finding Description

Scaled borrow shares are converted back into aggregate debt by multiplying them by the borrow index in `calculate_supplier_rewards`. [1](#0-0) 

`Ray::mul` ultimately requires the resulting `i128` value to be representable; `try_mul_div_half_up` returns `None` when the result does not fit, and `mul_div_half_up` converts that into `MathOverflow`. [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) 

Although `update_borrow_index` caps the index at `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, it does not bound `borrowed * index`; the capped index can therefore still produce an unrepresentable aggregate debt value. [4](#0-3) 

Every market mutation loads its cache through `synced_market`, which unconditionally calls `interest::global_sync`. [5](#0-4) 

`global_sync` invokes `accrue_step`, which reaches `calculate_supplier_rewards`, before any operation-specific accounting occurs. [6](#0-5) [7](#0-6) 

Consequently, `withdraw` reaches accrual through `ops::load_leg` before resolving or burning supply shares, and `repay` reaches the same accrual path before resolving or burning debt shares. [8](#0-7) [9](#0-8) 

The pool exposes the corresponding owner-mediated `borrow`, `withdraw`, `repay`, and `update_indexes` operations to the controller. [10](#0-9) 

The controller exposes the user-facing `borrow`, `withdraw`, `repay`, `liquidate`, `clean_bad_debt`, and `flash_loan` entrypoints that route into these pool operations. [11](#0-10) 

### Impact Explanation

Once aggregate debt value crosses the `i128` boundary, the market can no longer complete accrual, so users cannot repay debt, withdraw collateral, liquidate the position, settle bad debt, or claim revenue from that market.

This creates permanent freezing of supplied collateral and borrowed-market liquidity rather than a transient failure: retrying the same entrypoints repeats the same overflowing accrual calculation before any recovery logic runs.

The invariant documentation explicitly notes that value overflow can block repayment and withdrawal because those operations accrue first. [12](#0-11) 

### Likelihood Explanation

Exploitation requires a very large debt book relative to the RAY domain, so ordinary market sizes are unlikely to reach the boundary quickly.

The issue does not require privileged access beyond the ability to create the large legitimate position: the attacker can supply collateral, borrow the asset at high utilization, leave the position open while interest accrues, and then invoke the public index-update path to trigger the overflow.

Existing test coverage demonstrates that a large 18-decimal market at 98% utilization reaches `MATH_OVERFLOW` during `update_indexes` before the borrow-index ceiling engages, after which both withdrawal and repayment revert. [13](#0-12) [14](#0-13) 

### Recommendation

Enforce a market-level debt ceiling that guarantees `borrowed * MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY / RAY` remains representable in `i128`, not merely a ceiling on the borrow index itself.

Apply that bound when admitting new debt in `calculate_scaled_borrow` and when evaluating aggregate borrow caps, so an attacker cannot create a scaled debt balance that later becomes unrecoverable through normal accrual. [15](#0-14) 

Accrual should also handle the index ceiling explicitly before calculating aggregate rewards: once `old_borrow_index == MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`, return a no-interest step rather than multiplying the stored shares by the capped index. [4](#0-3) 

### Proof of Concept

1. Configure or select a market whose asset cap and collateral configuration permit an extremely large 18-decimal borrow.
2. Supply enough collateral and borrow approximately 98% of a very large supplied balance through `Controller::borrow`.
3. Advance ledger time while utilization remains high so `borrow_index` grows through `Controller::update_indexes`.
4. When `borrowed * borrow_index / RAY` exceeds `i128::MAX`, `calculate_supplier_rewards` panics with `MathOverflow` inside `accrue_step`. [16](#0-15) 
5. Subsequent `repay`, `withdraw`, `liquidate`, `clean_bad_debt`, `claim_revenue`, and `update_indexes` calls for that market all revert before their state changes because each loads the market through the same accrual path. [5](#0-4) 

The committed regression test implements this sequence and asserts that `update_indexes`, `withdraw`, and `repay` all fail with `MATH_OVERFLOW` while the index remains below `MAX_BORROW_INDEX_RAY`. [17](#0-16)

The token-to-RAY maximum is also the admitted cap maximum. Accrued position
values and market totals must independently fit the RAY domain; valid caps and
bounded indexes do not guarantee that future accrual fits. Value overflow can
occur before the index ceiling and block repayment/withdrawal because those
operations accrue first. At the borrow-index ceiling, further accrual produces
no borrower interest. No dedicated ceiling alarm is emitted.
