### Title
Accrual-time RAY multiplication overflows and permanently freezes a large utilized market - (File: common/src/rates/simulate.rs)

### Summary
An unprivileged caller can leave a market with enough scaled debt that normal time-based interest accrual overflows `i128` while converting `borrowed * borrow_index` to an underlying value. Because every pool mutation and the permissionless `update_indexes` path accrue before operating, the first post-threshold call panics and the market can no longer process withdrawals, repayments, liquidation, recapitalization, or revenue claims. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) 

### Finding Description
`update_indexes` is permissionless apart from caller authorization and forwards selected markets to the pool. [3](#0-2)  The pool loads each market and calls `interest::global_sync`, which invokes `accrue_step` for each elapsed chunk before committing the updated timestamp. [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) 

`accrue_step` first computes `scaled_to_original(borrowed, borrow_index)` and `scaled_to_original(supplied, supply_index)`. [6](#0-5)  `scaled_to_original` performs a RAY multiplication, so a scaled market balance multiplied by its current index must fit in `i128`; otherwise it panics with `MathOverflow`. [7](#0-6) [8](#0-7) 

The index ceiling does not prevent this condition: `update_borrow_index` caps the index only after multiplying the old index by the next interest factor, while the already stored `borrowed * borrow_index` product can become unrepresentable earlier. [9](#0-8)  Once that state is reached, `mark_accrued` is never reached, `last_timestamp` remains stale, and every later accrual retries the same overflowing calculation. [10](#0-9) 

### Impact Explanation
This permanently freezes all funds and operations associated with the affected `(hub_id, asset)` book. Supply, borrow, withdraw, repay, seize, flash-loan, recapitalization, and revenue operations all load or sync the same market before their mutation, and `update_indexes` itself cannot recover the market because it runs the same accrual first. [11](#0-10) [2](#0-1) 

Users cannot withdraw supplied assets, borrowers cannot repay, and liquidators cannot liquidate the market, so pool cash and user collateral remain inaccessible under the deployed implementation. [12](#0-11) 

### Likelihood Explanation
The exploit requires a very large scaled balance and a sufficiently grown index; however, both values are reachable through the ordinary `supply` and `borrow` entrypoints when market caps, collateralization, liquidity, and utilization permit them. [13](#0-12) [14](#0-13) [15](#0-14) 

After the vulnerable state exists, any unprivileged authorized address can trigger it by calling `update_indexes(caller, vec![hub_asset])`; no privileged action or malformed external contract is needed. [3](#0-2)  The substantial capitalization and sustained high-utilization requirements make this a Medium-severity conditional denial of service rather than an immediately practical Critical exploit.

### Recommendation
Bound scaled market totals against the representable value at the maximum index before accepting new supply or debt, and make accrual handle products above the RAY value domain without reverting the entire market. The accrual path should cap or saturate the computed underlying totals and then clamp the affected index deterministically, so repayment, withdrawal, liquidation, and recapitalization remain reachable even after an index boundary is crossed. [16](#0-15) [17](#0-16) 

A direct guard should reject entries where `scaled_amount * index / RAY` would exceed `i128::MAX`; alternatively, maintain market totals in a wider representation such as `I256` and only expose bounded `i128` results after checked conversion. [18](#0-17) 

### Proof of Concept
1. Create or use an active listed market whose supply and borrow caps permit a very large scaled balance.
2. Through `Controller::supply`, deposit a large amount of the market asset, for example approximately `1_000_000_000 * 10^18` base units for an 18-decimal asset where the cap permits it. [19](#0-18) 
3. Through `Controller::borrow`, borrow almost all supplied liquidity, such as 98% of that balance, after providing sufficient collateral in another market. [20](#0-19) 
4. Leave the market at sustained high utilization until `borrowed * borrow_index / RAY` no longer fits in `i128`, then call `Controller::update_indexes` for the market. [21](#0-20) [3](#0-2) 
5. The call panics with `MathOverflow`, and subsequent `withdraw` and `repay` attempts fail for the same reason because each operation performs accrual before its requested mutation. [22](#0-21) [2](#0-1) 

The repository already contains a regression-style demonstration in `a_whale_market_at_sustained_high_utilization_hits_the_ray_value_ceiling_before_the_index_cap`, which shows the index cap remains unengaged and both withdrawal and repayment revert after the overflow. [23](#0-22)
