**Analysis:**

The exploit hypothesis requires that a late entrant could stake *after* rewards have already accrued to `total_staked_balance`/`total_stake_shares` but be attributed as if it participated before the reward. This doesn't hold here.

Every public entrypoint that can change stake ownership (`stake`, `stake_all`, `deposit_and_stake`, `unstake`, `unstake_all`) unconditionally calls `internal_ping()` **before** `internal_stake`/`inner_unstake` runs: [1](#0-0) 

`internal_ping()` settles all pending rewards (increasing `total_staked_balance` and minting the owner's fee shares) strictly against the *existing* `total_stake_shares` before any new share-minting from the incoming `stake()` call happens: [2](#0-1) 

Because ping is always invoked first, any reward that accrued in prior epochs is fully distributed to the shares that existed at the time the reward was earned. A new staker's `internal_stake` call only mints shares at the *post-reward* share price computed via `num_shares_from_staked_amount_rounded_down`, so it is mathematically impossible for new capital to retroactively claim a slice of rewards that were already baked into the share price: [3](#0-2) 

The `NUM_EPOCHS_TO_UNLOCK` (4-epoch) constant only governs when previously-unstaked balance becomes withdrawable; it has no coupling to share-price/reward attribution and is checked independently in `internal_withdraw`: [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4) 

Splitting capital across sixteen accounts does not change the outcome, since `num_shares_from_staked_amount_rounded_down` and `staked_amount_from_num_shares_rounded_down`/`_up` are deterministic, global-price functions independent of account count; rounding in `internal_stake` (share count rounded down, then `charge_amount` rounded down, `stake_amount` rounded up) always favors the pool/guarantee fund, never the staker, so there is no exploitable one-yocto residual that benefits an attacker: [6](#0-5) 

There is no code path where a public call can order itself to intercept rewards belonging to earlier stakers — `ping` always precedes share-minting for the caller's own new stake in the same transaction, and any other account's pending rewards from a *previous* un-pinged epoch are settled atomically in the same `internal_ping()` invocation, based on shares held *before* the call, not after.
