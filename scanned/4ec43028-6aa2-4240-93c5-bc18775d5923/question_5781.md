# Q5781: save — method shadowing via pagination cursors

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request at `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`, makes `Rest::Base#save` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#save`
- Entrypoint: `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`
- Attacker controls: `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
