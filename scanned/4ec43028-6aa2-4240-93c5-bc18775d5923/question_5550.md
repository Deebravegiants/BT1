# Q5550: uri_from_shop_domain — shop name reconstructed, not validated via scheme injection

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://` at the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`, makes `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the returned `"#{shop}.myshopify.com"` is manufactured by string concatenation and never re-validated? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`
- Attacker controls: a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://`
- Exploit idea: the returned `"#{shop}.myshopify.com"` is manufactured by string concatenation and never re-validated
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
