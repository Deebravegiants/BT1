# Q4772: vault-accrue via redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` of shares burned reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with `amount` of shares burned varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
