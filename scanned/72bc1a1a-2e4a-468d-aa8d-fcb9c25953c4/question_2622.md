# Q2622: index auto-approve confusion via index

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp and manipulate `port`, `port`, and request ordering so that `index` in `features/public-key-provider/module/index.ts` make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket, breaking the invariant that string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context, and leading to `Sitewide disruption of core services`?

## Target
- File/function: features/public-key-provider/module/index.ts::index
- Entrypoint: provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp
- Attacker controls: a request that mixes canonical and non-canonical origin forms, ports, or host spellings
- Exploit idea: make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket
- Invariant to test: string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Sitewide disruption of core services
- Fast validation: unit-test canonical and non-canonical origin forms and verify they never share trust or auto-approve state unexpectedly
