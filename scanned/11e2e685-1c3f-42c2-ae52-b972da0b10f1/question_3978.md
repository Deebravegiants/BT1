# Q3978: insert via collateral-add: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `insert` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
