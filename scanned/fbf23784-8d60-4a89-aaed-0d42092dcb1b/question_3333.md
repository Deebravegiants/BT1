# Q3333: feature flags atom unsafe config merge via factory

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state with crafted `name`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `factory` in `features/feature-flags/atoms/feature-flags-atom.js` replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent, violating the invariant that remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/feature-flags/atoms/feature-flags-atom.js::factory
- Entrypoint: wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state
- Attacker controls: default-enabled configuration fields that toggle security-sensitive behavior
- Exploit idea: replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent
- Invariant to test: remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: load config for one network or account context, switch context, and ensure fee or policy data is not silently reused
