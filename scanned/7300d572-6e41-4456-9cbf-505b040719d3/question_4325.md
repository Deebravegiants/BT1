# Q4325: accrue-collateral-asset via repay: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), drive `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) — which maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel — to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `repay` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
