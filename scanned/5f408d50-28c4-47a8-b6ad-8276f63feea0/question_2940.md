# Q2940: Amount edge nep141:dash.omft.near feeInclusive: true `amount` above the token's `mi (signAndSendWithdrawalIntent)

## Question
For `nep141:dash.omft.near` via PoaBridge with `feeInclusive: true` and `amount` above the token's `min_withdrawal_amount` but below it after fee subtraction (min check runs against `actualAmount` in `createWithdrawalIntents` but against the fee-less amount elsewhere), can an unprivileged caller of `IntentsSDK.signAndSendWithdrawalIntent` with a caller-supplied `feeEstimation` produce intents whose total debit (withdraw amount + `token_diff` amount_in + storage deposit) differs from `withdrawalParams.amount` plus the displayed `feeEstimation.amount`, given that PoaBridge adds `relayerFee` back onto `amount` in `createWithdrawalIntents`; fee is paid in the withdrawn token, so the user is overcharged or the bridge receives an amount it refunds to intents.near instead of the user?

## Target
- File/function: packages/intents-sdk/src/sdk.ts `createWithdrawalIntents` (actualAmount), `_estimateWithdrawalFee` (FeeExceedsAmountError); packages/intents-sdk/src/bridges/poa-bridge/poa-bridge.ts `createWithdrawalIntents`, `validateWithdrawal`
- Entrypoint: `IntentsSDK.signAndSendWithdrawalIntent` with a caller-supplied `feeEstimation` (skips `_estimateWithdrawalFee`'s `FeeExceedsAmountError` and re-validates only inside `createWithdrawalIntents`)
- Attacker controls: `amount`, `feeInclusive`, and (for signAndSendWithdrawalIntent) the `feeEstimation` object itself
- Exploit idea: min check runs against `actualAmount` in `createWithdrawalIntents` but against the fee-less amount elsewhere. `createWithdrawalIntents` subtracts the fee without the `FeeExceedsAmountError` guard that only `_estimateWithdrawalFee` applies. adds `relayerFee` back onto `amount` in `createWithdrawalIntents`; fee is paid in the withdrawn token.
- Invariant to test: sum(debits in produced intents) == amount + (feeInclusive ? 0 : fee) and destination receives amount - (feeInclusive ? fee : 0), both non-negative; else throw before signing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - fee overcharge or solver overpaid beyond the displayed fee (HackenProof: fee estimation calculations)
- Fast validation: vitest: call `IntentsSDK.signAndSendWithdrawalIntent` with a caller-supplied `feeEstimation` with a mocked `FeeEstimation` for PoaBridge, parse the returned intents and sum amounts as BigInt; assert against the formula.
