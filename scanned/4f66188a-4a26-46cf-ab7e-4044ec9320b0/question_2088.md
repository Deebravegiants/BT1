# Q2088: calc-index-next via redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `calc-index-next` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
