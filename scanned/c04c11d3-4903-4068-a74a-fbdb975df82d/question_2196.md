# Q2196: request_url — dev-mode rewrite in production via shop.dev host

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` from the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation with a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite: because the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
