# Q2900: send-tokens via collateral-remove-redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `min-underlying` varied, and assert that the value `send-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
