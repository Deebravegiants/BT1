# Q3820: send-tokens via supply-collateral-add: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
