# Q4646: serialized_error — dev-mode rewrite in production via extra_headers

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error` from `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers with `extra_headers` merged after the base headers, able to override `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, `Host` or `Content-Type`: because the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: `extra_headers` merged after the base headers, able to override `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, `Host` or `Content-Type`
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
