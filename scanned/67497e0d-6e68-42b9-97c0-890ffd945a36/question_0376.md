# Q376: == — parsing is lossy via compressed vs expanded asymmetry

## Question
Trace `Auth::AuthScopes#==` from `AuthScopes#==` and `hash`, which compare only `compressed_scopes` with a comparison where the caller's required scopes are compressed and the session's are expanded: because splitting and stripping can merge or drop entries so the parsed set differs from the granted grant, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#==`
- Entrypoint: `AuthScopes#==` and `hash`, which compare only `compressed_scopes`
- Attacker controls: a comparison where the caller's required scopes are compressed and the session's are expanded
- Exploit idea: splitting and stripping can merge or drop entries so the parsed set differs from the granted grant
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `AuthScopes.new('write_x').covers?(AuthScopes.new('read_x'))` cannot be reached with a fabricated `x`
