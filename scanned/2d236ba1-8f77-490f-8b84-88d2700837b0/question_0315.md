# Q315: decode_token — type assumptions via expired but rotated

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#decode_token` through the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')` while supplying a token that fails under the current secret and is retried under `old_api_secret_key` by the rescue branch, so that `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: a token that fails under the current secret and is retried under `old_api_secret_key` by the rescue branch
- Exploit idea: `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
