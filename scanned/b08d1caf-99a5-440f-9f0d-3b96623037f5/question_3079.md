# Q3079: shopify_user_id — rotation widens acceptance via iss suffix

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an `iss` that merely ends with `/admin` (for example `https://evil.example/admin`), satisfying `admin_session_token?` at `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, makes `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: an `iss` that merely ends with `/admin` (for example `https://evil.example/admin`), satisfying `admin_session_token?`
- Exploit idea: the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
