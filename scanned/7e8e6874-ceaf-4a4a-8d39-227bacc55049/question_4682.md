# Q4682: request — mutable shared header hash via base_path argument

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `base_path:` argument, concatenated into `@base_uri_and_path` with no separator normalisation at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, makes `Clients::HttpClient#request` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: the `base_path:` argument, concatenated into `@base_uri_and_path` with no separator normalisation
- Exploit idea: `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
