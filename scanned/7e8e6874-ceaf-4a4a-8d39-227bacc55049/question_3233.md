# Q3233: initialize — leeway on both ends via aud edge

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key) at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header, makes `JwtPayload#initialize` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key)
- Exploit idea: a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
