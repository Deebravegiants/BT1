# Q2650: initialize — response content into logs via path traversal segments

## Question
Can `../` or `%2e%2e%2f` segments in `path` that climb out of the versioned base path, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, make `Clients::HttpClient#initialize` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`
- Attacker controls: `../` or `%2e%2e%2f` segments in `path` that climb out of the versioned base path
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
