# Q2253: debt-add-scaled via liquidate: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) — which stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `liquidate` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `debt-add-scaled` touches, run `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
