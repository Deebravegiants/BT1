# Q5703: user-safe-mask via liquidate-multi: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `user-safe-mask` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
