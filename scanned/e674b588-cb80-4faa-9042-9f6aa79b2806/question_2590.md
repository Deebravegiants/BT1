# Q2590: increment via liquidate: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `increment` advances the user-id nonce, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `liquidate` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
