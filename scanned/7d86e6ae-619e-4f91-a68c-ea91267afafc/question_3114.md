# Q3114: remote config cross-context fee reuse via createRemoteConfigAtom

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `port`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `createRemoteConfigAtom` in `features/remote-config/atoms/remote-config.ts` normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard, violating the invariant that cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed, and leading to `Direct theft of user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/remote-config/atoms/remote-config.ts::createRemoteConfigAtom
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: ETag or Last-Modified transitions combined with repeated load / update calls
- Exploit idea: normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard
- Invariant to test: cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: seed the persisted config atom with stale or conflicting values, restart the module, and assert safer defaults or fresh values win before sensitive actions occur
