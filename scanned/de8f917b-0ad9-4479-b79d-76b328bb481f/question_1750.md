# Q1750: shop — shop never domain-validated via leeway window

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#shop` through `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")` while supplying a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf`, so that the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf`
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
