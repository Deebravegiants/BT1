# Q5701: get-full-position via liquidate-redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) — which returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap — to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, breaking the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, then read `get-full-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
