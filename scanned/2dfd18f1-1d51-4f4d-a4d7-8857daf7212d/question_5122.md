# Q5122: request — header override ordering via extra_headers

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpClient#request` from `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request with `extra_headers` merged after the base headers, able to override `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, `Host` or `Content-Type`: because `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: `extra_headers` merged after the base headers, able to override `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, `Host` or `Content-Type`
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
