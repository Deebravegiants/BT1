# Q2432: auth_base_uri — redirect target unbound via private/embedded config

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself to the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`, does `Oauth.auth_base_uri` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time? Close the question on SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself
- Exploit idea: `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `begin_auth(shop: 'a.myshopify.com')`, then `validate_auth_callback` with a validly signed query naming shop B, and assert the returned `session.shop`
