# Q343: metadata proxy capability bleed via getIconData

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through dapp-controlled page metadata ingestion during wallet connect / approval UI rendering and control `origin`, `icon`, and `name` so that `getIconData` in `libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/metadata.js` confuse a seed-ingesting or wallet-mutating proxy into accepting attacker-controlled material in a read-mostly path, breaking the invariant that request IDs and callback routing must not let one website receive another website's wallet results, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/metadata.js::getIconData
- Entrypoint: dapp-controlled page metadata ingestion during wallet connect / approval UI rendering
- Attacker controls: a seed-bearing or signing-related payload routed through a generic RPC namespace
- Exploit idea: confuse a seed-ingesting or wallet-mutating proxy into accepting attacker-controlled material in a read-mostly path
- Invariant to test: request IDs and callback routing must not let one website receive another website's wallet results
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: drive a signing-capable request through the generic proxy path and assert it cannot import, mutate, or expose wallet secrets
