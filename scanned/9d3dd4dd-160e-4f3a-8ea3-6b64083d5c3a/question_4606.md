# Q4606: sanitize_shop_domain — parse/resolve divergence via suffix-confusion host

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` through a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` while supplying a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`, so that what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`
- Exploit idea: what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
