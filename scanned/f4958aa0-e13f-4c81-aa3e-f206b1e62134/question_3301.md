# Q3301: request — mutable shared header hash via query/fragment injection

## Question
Can a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, make `Clients::HttpClient#request` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query
- Exploit idea: `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
