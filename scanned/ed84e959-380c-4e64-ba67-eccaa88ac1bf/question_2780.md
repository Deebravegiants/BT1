# Q2780: shopify_user_id — leeway on both ends via dest without scheme

## Question
Starting from `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip) so that a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip)
- Exploit idea: a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
