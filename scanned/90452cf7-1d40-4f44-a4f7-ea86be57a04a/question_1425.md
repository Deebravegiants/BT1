# Q1425: unified_admin? — differential between the two entry points via userinfo bypass

## Question
Can a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`, make `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
