# Q2397: cookie_session_id — interpolation collision via omitted id token

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch to `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key, does `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch
- Exploit idea: string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
