# Q4010: calc-treasury-lp-preview via redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption varied, and assert that the value `calc-treasury-lp-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
