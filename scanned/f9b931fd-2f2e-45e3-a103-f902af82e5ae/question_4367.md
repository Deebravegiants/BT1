# Q4367: receive-tokens via repay: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
`receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) pulls an asset from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, violating the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `repay` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
