# Q5254: uri_from_shop_domain — normalisation happens after the decision via embedded port

## Question
Can a shop string carrying an explicit port such as `victim.myshopify.com:8443` or `myshopify.com:80@evil.example`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`, make `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the value returned is `uri.host`, not the fully normalised string the caller later interpolates? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`
- Attacker controls: a shop string carrying an explicit port such as `victim.myshopify.com:8443` or `myshopify.com:80@evil.example`
- Exploit idea: the value returned is `uri.host`, not the fully normalised string the caller later interpolates
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
