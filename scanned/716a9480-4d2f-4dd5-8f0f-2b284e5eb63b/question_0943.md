# Q943: offline_session_id — fallback weakens the strong path via Bearer interior match

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` from `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation with an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded: because an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded
- Exploit idea: an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
