# Q3429: auth_base_uri — private-app guard ordering via host parameter

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself at the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`, makes `Oauth.auth_base_uri` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself
- Exploit idea: `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
