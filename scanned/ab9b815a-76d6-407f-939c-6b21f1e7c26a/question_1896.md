# Q1896: key state public_key publicly reachable state transitions

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `public_key` and use the chosen predecessor override, derivation path, queried domain or curve, and timing relative to key-version changes to drive the code path through `crates/contract/src/primitives/key_state.rs::public_key` so that publicly reachable state transitions become signer-only or participant-only operations, breaking the invariant that every privileged transition must be guarded before any mutable side effect is created, and leading to Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability?

## Target
- File/function: crates/contract/src/primitives/key_state.rs:47::public_key
- Entrypoint: `public_key`
- Attacker controls: the chosen predecessor override, derivation path, queried domain or curve, and timing relative to key-version changes
- Exploit idea: publicly reachable state transitions become signer-only or participant-only operations
- Invariant to test: every privileged transition must be guarded before any mutable side effect is created
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability
- Fast validation: call the public method from a non-participant account and inspect whether any storage, vote, pending-state, or callback side effect survives the rejection path
