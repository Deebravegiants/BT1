# Q2323: add_registration — GraphQL built by interpolation via webhook_id from a response

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `webhook_id` taken from an upstream response and interpolated directly into the delete mutation string at `add_registration(topic:, delivery_method:, path:, handler:, fields:, filter:, metafield_namespaces:)`, makes `Webhooks::Registry.add_registration` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that topic and `webhook_id` are concatenated into query documents rather than passed as variables? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.add_registration`
- Entrypoint: `add_registration(topic:, delivery_method:, path:, handler:, fields:, filter:, metafield_namespaces:)`
- Attacker controls: a `webhook_id` taken from an upstream response and interpolated directly into the delete mutation string
- Exploit idea: topic and `webhook_id` are concatenated into query documents rather than passed as variables
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay one signed delivery twice and assert the handler is invoked at most once per `webhook-id`
