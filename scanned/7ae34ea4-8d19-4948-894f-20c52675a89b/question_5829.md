# Q5829: get_path_ids — method shadowing via original_state diff

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.get_path_ids` from `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires with the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends: because a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path_ids`
- Entrypoint: `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires
- Attacker controls: the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
