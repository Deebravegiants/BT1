# Q622: migrate_to_expiring_token — client_secret sent to a derived host via replayed subject token

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the same `subject_token` submitted repeatedly, since nothing tracks consumption at `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`, makes `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the POST body carries `client_id` and `client_secret` to `https://#{dest_shop}/admin/oauth/access_token`? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Entrypoint: `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`
- Attacker controls: the same `subject_token` submitted repeatedly, since nothing tracks consumption
- Exploit idea: the POST body carries `client_id` and `client_secret` to `https://#{dest_shop}/admin/oauth/access_token`
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `exchange_token` sanitises `dest_shop` the same way `migrate_to_expiring_token` sanitises its `shop:` argument
