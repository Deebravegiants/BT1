# Q185: to_signable_string — ambiguous concatenation via unicode normalisation

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a value that normalises differently between the browser, the framework and `URI.encode_www_form` to `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback, does `AuthQuery#to_signable_string` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because two different parameter sets serialise to the same signable string? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback
- Attacker controls: a value that normalises differently between the browser, the framework and `URI.encode_www_form`
- Exploit idea: two different parameter sets serialise to the same signable string
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `to_signable_string` includes every field the callback route reads, by reflecting over the route's params
