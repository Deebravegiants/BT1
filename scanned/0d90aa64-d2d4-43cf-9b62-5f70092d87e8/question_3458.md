# Q3458: index unsafe config merge via createFeatureFlags

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state with crafted `name`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `createFeatureFlags` in `features/feature-flags/module/index.js` replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent, violating the invariant that remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context, and leading to `Sitewide disruption of core services`?

## Target
- File/function: features/feature-flags/module/index.js::createFeatureFlags
- Entrypoint: wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state
- Attacker controls: default-enabled configuration fields that toggle security-sensitive behavior
- Exploit idea: replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent
- Invariant to test: remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Sitewide disruption of core services
- Fast validation: fuzz config normalization with ambiguous booleans, arrays, and object merges and assert no privilege-widening output is produced
