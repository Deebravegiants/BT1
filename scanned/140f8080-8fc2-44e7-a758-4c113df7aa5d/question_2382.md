# Q2382: resolve-interpolation-points via collateral-remove: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `resolve-interpolation-points` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
