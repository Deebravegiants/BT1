# Q1042: attestation verify a one-time artifact can

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account or outsider node trying to look like a valid participant enter through `submit_participant_info / verify_tee` and use attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification to drive the code path through `crates/mpc-attestation/src/attestation.rs::verify` so that a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime, breaking the invariant that completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch, and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: crates/mpc-attestation/src/attestation.rs:116::verify
- Entrypoint: `submit_participant_info / verify_tee`
- Attacker controls: attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification
- Exploit idea: a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime
- Invariant to test: completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: force a retry or restart boundary, then resend the old artifact and verify whether it still affects request resolution or signature completion
