# Q1400: check-confidence via supply-collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `check-confidence` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
