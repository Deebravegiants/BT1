# Q2863: topic — no replay protection via relabelled topic header

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#topic` through `Request#topic`, reading the unsigned `shopify-topic` / `x-shopify-topic` header while supplying the `x-shopify-topic` header, which selects the handler in `Registry.process`, so that no nonce, timestamp or delivery-id tracking bounds re-delivery of a signed body, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#topic`
- Entrypoint: `Request#topic`, reading the unsigned `shopify-topic` / `x-shopify-topic` header
- Attacker controls: the `x-shopify-topic` header, which selects the handler in `Registry.process`
- Exploit idea: no nonce, timestamp or delivery-id tracking bounds re-delivery of a signed body
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
