# Q1973: get_path — dynamic dispatch on response data via ids hash

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path at `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids, makes `Rest::Base.get_path` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids
- Attacker controls: the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
