# Q5279: sanitize_shop_domain — dev-domain entries reachable in production via percent-encoded separator

## Question
Starting from a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments so that `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties? Determine whether SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` still holds through `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments
- Exploit idea: `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
