# Q224: initialize — id and shop can disagree via nil expires

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Auth::Session#initialize` through `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable while supplying an access-token response with no `expires_in`, leaving `@expires` nil and `expired?` permanently false, so that `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable
- Attacker controls: an access-token response with no `expires_in`, leaving `@expires` nil and `expired?` permanently false
- Exploit idea: `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
