# Q5905: interest-rate via liquidate-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, drive `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) — which interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization — to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, breaking the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, then read `interest-rate` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
