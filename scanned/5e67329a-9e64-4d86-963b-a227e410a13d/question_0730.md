# Q730: protocol poke a one-time artifact can

## Question
Can a below-threshold Byzantine participant node enter through `authenticated P2P message flow during sign / request_app_private_key / verify_foreign_transaction` and use authenticated MPC/P2P frames, connection churn, message ordering, duplicates, channel/task identifiers, and stale session state to drive the code path through `crates/threshold-signatures/src/protocol.rs::poke` so that a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime, breaking the invariant that completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch, and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: crates/threshold-signatures/src/protocol.rs:90::poke
- Entrypoint: `authenticated P2P message flow during sign / request_app_private_key / verify_foreign_transaction`
- Attacker controls: authenticated MPC/P2P frames, connection churn, message ordering, duplicates, channel/task identifiers, and stale session state
- Exploit idea: a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime
- Invariant to test: completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: force a retry or restart boundary, then resend the old artifact and verify whether it still affects request resolution or signature completion
