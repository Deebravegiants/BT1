# Q4566: is-healthy-with-mask via collateral-remove-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `is-healthy-with-mask` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
