# Q2053: iter-lookup-debt via repay: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) — which skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `repay` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `iter-lookup-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
