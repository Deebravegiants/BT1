# Q1661: interpolate-rate via borrow: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, drive `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) — which interpolates between packed u16 curve points — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `borrow` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
