# Q2125: parse_check_result — GraphQL by interpolation via topic string

## Question
Can the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `parse_check_result(body)`, which reads `callbackUrl`, `includeFields`, `metafieldNamespaces` and `filter` out of a GraphQL response, make `Registrations::Http#parse_check_result` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that topic and argument strings are concatenated into the document rather than passed as variables? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#parse_check_result`
- Entrypoint: `parse_check_result(body)`, which reads `callbackUrl`, `includeFields`, `metafieldNamespaces` and `filter` out of a GraphQL response
- Attacker controls: the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted
- Exploit idea: topic and argument strings are concatenated into the document rather than passed as variables
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `callback_address` never returns a host outside the app's own origin
