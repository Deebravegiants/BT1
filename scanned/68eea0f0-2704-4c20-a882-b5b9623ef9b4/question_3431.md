# Q3431: admin_session_token? — type assumptions via dest without scheme

## Question
Starting from `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip) so that `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip)
- Exploit idea: `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
