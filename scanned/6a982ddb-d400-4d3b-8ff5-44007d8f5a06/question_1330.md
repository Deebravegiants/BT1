# Q1330: auth_base_uri — session id derived from callback input via private/embedded config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Oauth.auth_base_uri` through the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator` while supplying an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself, so that `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself
- Exploit idea: `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
