# Q4987: append_first_party_development_headers — token attached before destination is settled via scheme in path

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL to `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, does `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL
- Exploit idea: `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
