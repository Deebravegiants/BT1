# Q4928: create_instance — path interpolation from ids via primary key value

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Rest::Base.create_instance` through `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)` while supplying the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path, so that ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.create_instance`
- Entrypoint: `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`
- Attacker controls: the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path
- Exploit idea: ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
