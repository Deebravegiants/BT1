# Q4868: save — dynamic dispatch on response data via original_state diff

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends to `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`, does `Rest::Base#save` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#save`
- Entrypoint: `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`
- Attacker controls: the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
