# Q1711: Amount edge nep141:tron-d28a265909efecdc feeInclusive: true `amount` above the token's `mi (processWithdrawal)

## Question
Using `IntentsSDK.processWithdrawal` with `nep141:tron-d28a265909efecdcee7c5028585214ea0b96f015.omft.near` (PoaBridge), `feeInclusive: true` and `amount` above the token's `min_withdrawal_amount` but below it after fee subtraction: because min check runs against `actualAmount` in `createWithdrawalIntents` but against the fee-less amount elsewhere and PoaBridge adds `relayerFee` back onto `amount` in `createWithdrawalIntents`; fee is paid in the withdrawn token, can the withdrawal be signed with an amount that is negative, zero, or below the bridge minimum after fee adjustment, so that intents.near debits the user while the bridge refunds to `intents.near` rather than to the signer?

## Target
- File/function: packages/intents-sdk/src/sdk.ts `createWithdrawalIntents` (actualAmount), `_estimateWithdrawalFee` (FeeExceedsAmountError); packages/intents-sdk/src/bridges/poa-bridge/poa-bridge.ts `createWithdrawalIntents`, `validateWithdrawal`
- Entrypoint: `IntentsSDK.processWithdrawal` (end-to-end: estimate -> validate -> sign -> publish -> wait)
- Attacker controls: `amount`, `feeInclusive`, and (for signAndSendWithdrawalIntent) the `feeEstimation` object itself
- Exploit idea: min check runs against `actualAmount` in `createWithdrawalIntents` but against the fee-less amount elsewhere. `createWithdrawalIntents` subtracts the fee without the `FeeExceedsAmountError` guard that only `_estimateWithdrawalFee` applies. adds `relayerFee` back onto `amount` in `createWithdrawalIntents`; fee is paid in the withdrawn token.
- Invariant to test: sum(debits in produced intents) == amount + (feeInclusive ? 0 : fee) and destination receives amount - (feeInclusive ? fee : 0), both non-negative; else throw before signing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - fee overcharge or solver overpaid beyond the displayed fee (HackenProof: fee estimation calculations)
- Fast validation: vitest: call `IntentsSDK.processWithdrawal` with a mocked `FeeEstimation` for PoaBridge, parse the returned intents and sum amounts as BigInt; assert against the formula.
