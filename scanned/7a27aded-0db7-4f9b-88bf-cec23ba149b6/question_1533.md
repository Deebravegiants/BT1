# Q1533: callback_address — unanchored host match via topic string

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Registrations::Http#callback_address` through `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host` while supplying the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted, so that the `^#{Context.host_name}` test is a prefix match on an unescaped interpolation, so a look-alike host passes, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted
- Exploit idea: the `^#{Context.host_name}` test is a prefix match on an unescaped interpolation, so a look-alike host passes
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: set `Context.host_name` and assert `callback_address` rejects a path whose prefix merely matches it
