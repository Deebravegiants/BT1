# Q4219: add-user-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
`add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, then read `add-user-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
