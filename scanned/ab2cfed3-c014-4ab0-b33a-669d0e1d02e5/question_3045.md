# Q3045: shop — header collision via body byte variance

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#shop` through `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header while supplying a raw body whose bytes differ from what the framework hands to `JSON.parse` (encoding conversion, BOM, trailing newline, rewound stream), so that two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup, breaking the requirement that BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shop`
- Entrypoint: `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header
- Attacker controls: a raw body whose bytes differ from what the framework hands to `JSON.parse` (encoding conversion, BOM, trailing newline, rewound stream)
- Exploit idea: two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
