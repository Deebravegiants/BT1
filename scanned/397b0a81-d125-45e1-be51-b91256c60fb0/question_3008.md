# Q3008: user-safe-mask via collateral-remove-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered, the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `user-safe-mask` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
