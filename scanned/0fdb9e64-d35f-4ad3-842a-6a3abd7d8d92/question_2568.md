# Q2568: mask-update via liquidate-multi: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) reach `mask-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:94` -> `mask-update`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `mask-update` sets or clears one bit, clearing only when the row reaches exactly zero. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `mask-update` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
