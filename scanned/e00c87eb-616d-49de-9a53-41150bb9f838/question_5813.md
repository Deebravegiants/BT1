# Q5813: zip via accrue: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) — which pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element — to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, breaking the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `accrue` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
