# Q796: jwt_session_id — unauthenticated bytes become the key via omitted id token

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` from `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation with an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch: because the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch
- Exploit idea: the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
