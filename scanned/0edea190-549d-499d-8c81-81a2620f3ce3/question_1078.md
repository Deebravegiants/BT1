# Q1078: begin_auth — cookie carries no shop via scope_override

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Oauth.begin_auth` through `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop` while supplying the `scope_override:` argument or the `redirect_path:` argument if the host route derives either from request input, so that `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: the `scope_override:` argument or the `redirect_path:` argument if the host route derives either from request input
- Exploit idea: `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
