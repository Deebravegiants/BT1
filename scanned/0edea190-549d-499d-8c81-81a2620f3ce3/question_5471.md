# Q5471: shop — handler chosen by unsigned data via base64url vs standard

## Question
Can a base64url-encoded digest (`-`/`_`) that `decode64` reinterprets, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header, make `Webhooks::Request#shop` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shop`
- Entrypoint: `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header
- Attacker controls: a base64url-encoded digest (`-`/`_`) that `decode64` reinterprets
- Exploit idea: `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
