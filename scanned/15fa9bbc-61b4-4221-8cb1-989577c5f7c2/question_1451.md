# Q1451: to_hash — method shadowing via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
Does `Rest::Base#to_hash` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name at `to_hash(saving)`, which walks `instance_variables` and filters `read_only_attributes`? Show that a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#to_hash`
- Entrypoint: `to_hash(saving)`, which walks `instance_variables` and filters `read_only_attributes`
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
