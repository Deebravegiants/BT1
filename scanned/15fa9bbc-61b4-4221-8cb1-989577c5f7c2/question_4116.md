# Q4116: request — string interpolation, not URL joining via scheme in path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#request` through `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request while supplying a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL, so that the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL
- Exploit idea: the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
