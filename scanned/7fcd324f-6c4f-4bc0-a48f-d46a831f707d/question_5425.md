# Q5425: shopify_header — presence check != usage via omitted optional headers

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header` through the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>` while supplying an omitted `x-shopify-api-version` or `x-shopify-webhook-id`, which `initialize` never requires but the accessors `T.cast` to String, so that `initialize` only requires `topic`, `hmac-sha256` and `shop-domain` to exist, never that they are well-formed, breaking the requirement that BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header`
- Entrypoint: the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`
- Attacker controls: an omitted `x-shopify-api-version` or `x-shopify-webhook-id`, which `initialize` never requires but the accessors `T.cast` to String
- Exploit idea: `initialize` only requires `topic`, `hmac-sha256` and `shop-domain` to exist, never that they are well-formed
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
