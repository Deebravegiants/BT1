# Q3129: from — equality omits the token via associated_user id

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Auth::Session.from` through `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"` while supplying the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id, so that `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.from`
- Entrypoint: `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`
- Attacker controls: the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id
- Exploit idea: `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
