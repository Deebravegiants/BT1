# Q2756: get-egroup via collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `get-egroup` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path, the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:460` -> `get-egroup`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `get-egroup` resolves the efficiency group for a mask and is unwrapped with `try!` on every health path. Reach it through `collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the position's existing collateral and debt composition varied, and assert that the value `get-egroup` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
