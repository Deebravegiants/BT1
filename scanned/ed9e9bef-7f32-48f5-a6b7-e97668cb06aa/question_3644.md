# Q3644: method_missing — path interpolation from ids via primary key value

## Question
Can the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access, make `Rest::Base#method_missing` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path
- Exploit idea: ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
