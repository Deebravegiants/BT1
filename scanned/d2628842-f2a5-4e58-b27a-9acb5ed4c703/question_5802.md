# Q5802: get_path_ids — method shadowing via attribute name with punctuation

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting at `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires, makes `Rest::Base.get_path_ids` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path_ids`
- Entrypoint: `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires
- Attacker controls: a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
