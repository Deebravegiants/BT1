# Q4304: cookie_session_id — interpolation collision via guessed offline key

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint at `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key, makes `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
