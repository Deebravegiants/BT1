# Q1461: shop — presence check != usage via duplicate header prefixes

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Request#shop` from `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header with both `shopify-topic` and `x-shopify-topic` set to different values, exploiting the `||` preference order: because `initialize` only requires `topic`, `hmac-sha256` and `shop-domain` to exist, never that they are well-formed, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shop`
- Entrypoint: `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header
- Attacker controls: both `shopify-topic` and `x-shopify-topic` set to different values, exploiting the `||` preference order
- Exploit idea: `initialize` only requires `topic`, `hmac-sha256` and `shop-domain` to exist, never that they are well-formed
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
