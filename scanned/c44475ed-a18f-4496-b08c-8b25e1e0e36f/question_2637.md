# Q2637: public key provider auto-approve confusion via getPublicKey

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp and manipulate `account`, `walletAccount`, and request ordering so that `getPublicKey` in `features/public-key-provider/module/public-key-provider.ts` make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket, breaking the invariant that string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context, and leading to `Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction`?

## Target
- File/function: features/public-key-provider/module/public-key-provider.ts::getPublicKey
- Entrypoint: provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp
- Attacker controls: a request that mixes canonical and non-canonical origin forms, ports, or host spellings
- Exploit idea: make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket
- Invariant to test: string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction
- Fast validation: rotate the seed or switch active accounts after caching addresses or keys and assert stale cache entries are rejected or invalidated
