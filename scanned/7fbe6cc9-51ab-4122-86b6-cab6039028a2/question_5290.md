# Q5290: shop — shop handed to handler unverified via relabelled topic header

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Request#shop` from `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header with the `x-shopify-topic` header, which selects the handler in `Registry.process`: because `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shop`
- Entrypoint: `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header
- Attacker controls: the `x-shopify-topic` header, which selects the handler in `Registry.process`
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `to_signable_string` equals the exact bytes later returned by `parsed_body.to_json`-round-tripped input, and diff on mismatch
