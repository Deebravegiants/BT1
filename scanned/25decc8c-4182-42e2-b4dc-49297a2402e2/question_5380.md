# Q5380: interpolate-rate via liquidate: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-collateral-expected` reach `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it interpolates between packed u16 curve points, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-collateral-expected`
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `liquidate` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `min-collateral-expected`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
