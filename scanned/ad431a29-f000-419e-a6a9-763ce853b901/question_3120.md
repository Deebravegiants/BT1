# Q3120: remote config startup policy race via createRemoteConfigAtom

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `port`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `createRemoteConfigAtom` in `features/remote-config/atoms/remote-config.ts` cause configuration to win a race against a safer local default at startup or resume, violating the invariant that safer local defaults must not be overwritten by stale or ambiguously merged remote state, and leading to `Sitewide disruption of core services`?

## Target
- File/function: features/remote-config/atoms/remote-config.ts::createRemoteConfigAtom
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: feature-flag, fee-data, or remote URL fields that are consumed before account-sensitive checks
- Exploit idea: cause configuration to win a race against a safer local default at startup or resume
- Invariant to test: safer local defaults must not be overwritten by stale or ambiguously merged remote state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Sitewide disruption of core services
- Fast validation: fuzz config normalization with ambiguous booleans, arrays, and object merges and assert no privilege-widening output is produced
