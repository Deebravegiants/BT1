# Q209: index cross-account signing via cachedSodiumEncryptorRpc

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `cachedSodiumEncryptorRpc` in `sdks/headless/src/features/cached-sodium-encryptor-rpc/index.js` through wallet RPC call that asks the SDK to decrypt or unlock persisted wallet material and supply crafted `port`, `port`, and `port` values that reuse cached decrypted material or exported key state across a lock, clear, or account boundary, violating the invariant that derivation scope must never expand beyond the exact approved path or account context, and causing `Direct theft of user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: sdks/headless/src/features/cached-sodium-encryptor-rpc/index.js::cachedSodiumEncryptorRpc
- Entrypoint: wallet RPC call that asks the SDK to decrypt or unlock persisted wallet material
- Attacker controls: the requested wallet account, derivation path, key identifier, and signing payload bytes
- Exploit idea: reuse cached decrypted material or exported key state across a lock, clear, or account boundary
- Invariant to test: derivation scope must never expand beyond the exact approved path or account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: unit-test two wallet accounts or seeds, request a sign/export on one, then swap context and assert the result cannot come from the other
