# Q5806: sanitize! — path segment trusted as identity via dotless name

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input to `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`, does `ShopValidator.sanitize!` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Entrypoint: `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input
- Exploit idea: the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
