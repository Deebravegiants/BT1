# Q5476: request — attacker-steered retry loop via error body content

## Question
Does `Clients::HttpClient#request` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a response body whose `errors`/`error_description` fields are echoed into the raised exception message at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request? Show that response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a response body whose `errors`/`error_description` fields are echoed into the raised exception message
- Exploit idea: response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
