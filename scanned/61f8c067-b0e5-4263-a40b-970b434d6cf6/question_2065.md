# Q2065: connected accounts permission scope widening via createConnectedAccountsAtom

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website and manipulate `accounts`, `port`, and request ordering so that `createConnectedAccountsAtom` in `features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-accounts.js` keep stale connected-account or address-cache data alive across seed rotation, restore, or account changes, breaking the invariant that origin trust and auto-approve state must be keyed by a canonical origin and the intended wallet account, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-accounts.js::createConnectedAccountsAtom
- Entrypoint: wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website
- Attacker controls: the origin string, wallet-account name, and the sequence of connect / sign / auto-approve actions
- Exploit idea: keep stale connected-account or address-cache data alive across seed rotation, restore, or account changes
- Invariant to test: origin trust and auto-approve state must be keyed by a canonical origin and the intended wallet account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: request a narrower asset/account scope first, then a broader one, and assert the module never silently widens the approved result
