# Q4927: calc-liq-collateral-repay via liquidate-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`calc-liq-collateral-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728) scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728` -> `calc-liq-collateral-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-collateral-repay` scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `calc-liq-collateral-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
