# Q2436: cookie_session_id — interpolation collision via shop casing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` through `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key while supplying a shop value differing only in case or trailing dot from the stored key, since keys are compared as raw strings, so that string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a shop value differing only in case or trailing dot from the stored key, since keys are compared as raw strings
- Exploit idea: string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
