# Q5016: system-repay via liquidate: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `liquidate` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `system-repay` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
