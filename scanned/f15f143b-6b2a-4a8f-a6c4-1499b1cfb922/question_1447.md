# Q1447: current_session_id — caller decides identity shape via shop with underscore

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.current_session_id` from `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves with a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key: because the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.current_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves
- Attacker controls: a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key
- Exploit idea: the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
