# Q5146: shopify_user_id — separator collision via Bearer prefix games

## Question
Starting from `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, can an unprivileged attacker supply an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix so that the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
