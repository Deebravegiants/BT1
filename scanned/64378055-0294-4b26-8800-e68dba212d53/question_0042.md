# Q42: expired? — identity built by interpolation via scope string

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Auth::Session#expired?` through `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil while supplying the `scope` string from the token response, parsed by `AuthScopes` with no validation, so that session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#expired?`
- Entrypoint: `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: the `scope` string from the token response, parsed by `AuthScopes` with no validation
- Exploit idea: session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
