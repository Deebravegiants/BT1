# Q2464: get — guard order via traversal to another version

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Rest::Admin#get` through `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input while supplying `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure, so that the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#get`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input
- Attacker controls: `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure
- Exploit idea: the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
