# Q5779: calc-liq-debt-repay via liquidate-multi: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`calc-liq-debt-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723) takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:723` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay` takes the liquidation factor times the debt with `mul-bps-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, then read `calc-liq-debt-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
