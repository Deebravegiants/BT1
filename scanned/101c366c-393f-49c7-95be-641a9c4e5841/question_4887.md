# Q4887: normalize via call-ststx-ratio: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
`normalize` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576) divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar. Can an unprivileged caller of `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), by choosing the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, use that to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, violating the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:576` -> `normalize`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `normalize` divides by `(pow u10 decimals)` only AFTER multiplying amount by price, making the protocol's USD unit a whole dollar. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `normalize` touches, run `call-ststx-ratio` with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
