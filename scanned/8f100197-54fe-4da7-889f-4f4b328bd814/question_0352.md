# Q0352: receive-tokens via transfer: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury reach `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it pulls an asset from a named account, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `transfer` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
