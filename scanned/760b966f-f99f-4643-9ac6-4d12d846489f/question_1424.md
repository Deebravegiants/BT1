# Q1424: user-safe-mask via collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order varied, and assert that the value `user-safe-mask` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
