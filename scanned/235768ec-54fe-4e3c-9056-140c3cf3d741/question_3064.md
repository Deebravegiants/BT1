# Q3064: setup? — thread-local, not request-local via thread-local session

## Question
Trace `Context.setup?` from `setup?`, which only checks that four strings are non-empty with the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread: because `active_session` is thread-local; on a pooled server a session can outlive the request that set it, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.setup?`
- Entrypoint: `setup?`, which only checks that four strings are non-empty
- Attacker controls: the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread
- Exploit idea: `active_session` is thread-local; on a pooled server a session can outlive the request that set it
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `activate_session` is cleared at the end of a request cycle so a pooled thread cannot serve a stale tenant
