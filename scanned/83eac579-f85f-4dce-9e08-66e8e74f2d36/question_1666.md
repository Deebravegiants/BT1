# Q1666: auth_base_uri — shop reaches HttpClient unvalidated via extra query parameters

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Oauth.auth_base_uri` through the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator` while supplying additional query keys outside the five that `to_signable_string` covers (`code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp`), so that `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: additional query keys outside the five that `to_signable_string` covers (`code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp`)
- Exploit idea: `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
