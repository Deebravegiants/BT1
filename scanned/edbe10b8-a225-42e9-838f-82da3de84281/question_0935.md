# Q0935: user-safe-mask via liquidate: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
`user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, use that to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `liquidate` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
