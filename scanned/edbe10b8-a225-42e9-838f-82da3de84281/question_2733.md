# Q2733: collateral-remove via repay: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) — which decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `repay` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `collateral-remove` touches, run `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
