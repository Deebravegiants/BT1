# Q2313: activate_session — thread-local, not request-local via api_host vs session.shop

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `api_host` setting, which splits the connection host from the `Host` header taken from `session.shop` to `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`, does `Context.activate_session` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `active_session` is thread-local; on a pooled server a session can outlive the request that set it? Close the question on SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.activate_session`
- Entrypoint: `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`
- Attacker controls: the `api_host` setting, which splits the connection host from the `Host` header taken from `session.shop`
- Exploit idea: `active_session` is thread-local; on a pooled server a session can outlive the request that set it
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: run two threads through `Session.temp` and assert neither observes the other's active session
