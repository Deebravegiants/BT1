# Q0332: migrate_builtin_to_core_bpf rounding drift is attacker-directed (mod.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `migrate_builtin_to_core_bpf` in `runtime/src/bank/builtins/core_bpf_migration/mod.rs` with a declared cost far below the real cost of the work requested, and make every rounding step inside `migrate_builtin_to_core_bpf` land in the attacker's favour across repeated calls, so that the invariant "Rounding is either exact or always rounds against the caller, and repeated operations cannot accumulate a positive drift." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank/builtins/core_bpf_migration/mod.rs` -> `migrate_builtin_to_core_bpf()` (around line 224)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a declared cost far below the real cost of the work requested
- Exploit idea: Choose amounts so every rounding step in `migrate_builtin_to_core_bpf` lands in the attacker's favour, then repeat the flow to accumulate the drift into a withdrawable balance.
- Invariant to test: Rounding is either exact or always rounds against the caller, and repeated operations cannot accumulate a positive drift.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Loop the operation N times in a unit test with adversarial amounts and assert the attacker's net balance never increases.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft a transaction whose fee, rent, rollback, or balance-commit accounting in the SVM lifecycle moves, mints, duplicates, or destroys lamports the signer does not own.
