# Q2431: principal-ratio-reduction via collateral-remove-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `receiver` for the underlying leg, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, then read `principal-ratio-reduction` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
