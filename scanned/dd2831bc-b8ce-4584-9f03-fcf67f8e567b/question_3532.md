# Q3532: balanceDif accounting with an ERC777 token with a tokensReceived hook via an Emporium external action [when the attacker sandwiches t]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route an Emporium external action using an ERC777 token with a tokensReceived hook, so that the hook re-enters Hinkal during the transfer, and make Hinkal.transact's post-transfer check `balanceDif == (onChainCreation ? 0 : amountChanges[i]) + utxoAmount` hold while the vault actually receives less value than the shielded UTXOs it mints, specifically when the attacker sandwiches the tx with their own deposit and withdraw (where surrounding state is attacker-tuned)?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Hinkal.sol :: transact / EmporiumUpgradeable.runAction
- Entrypoint: Hinkal.transact
- Attacker controls: erc20TokenAddresses, amountChanges, slippageValues, the deployed token, externalActionData
- Exploit idea: exploit that getBalancesForArray snapshots via balanceOf while the hook re-enters Hinkal during the transfer
- Invariant to test: net tokens entering Hinkal == sum(amountChanges) + sum(on-chain UTXO amounts minted)
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: minting shielded value without backing (protocol insolvency)
- Fast validation: Foundry: deploy the token, run the tx, assert vault balance delta < credited UTXO value
