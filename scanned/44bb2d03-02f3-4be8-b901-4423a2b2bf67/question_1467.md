# Q1467: save — dynamic dispatch on response data via params hash

## Question
Can the `params:` hash, forwarded as the outgoing query string, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`, make `Rest::Base#save` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#save`
- Entrypoint: `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`
- Attacker controls: the `params:` hash, forwarded as the outgoing query string
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
