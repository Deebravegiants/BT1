# Q3909: validate_auth_callback — HMAC precedes but does not bind via unsanitised shop param

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!` to `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, does `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Exploit idea: `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
