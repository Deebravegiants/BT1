# Q2566: append_first_party_development_headers — attacker-steered retry loop via absolute path

## Question
Can a `path` beginning with `/` or `//host`, which changes the authority the interpolated URL resolves to, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, make `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: a `path` beginning with `/` or `//host`, which changes the authority the interpolated URL resolves to
- Exploit idea: response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
