# Q0963: get_epoch_schedule is not deterministic across nodes (sysvar_cache.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_epoch_schedule` in `program-runtime/src/sysvar_cache.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and make the memory region bounds registered for the instruction disagree with the addresses the syscall actually dereferences, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `get_epoch_schedule` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/sysvar_cache.rs` -> `get_epoch_schedule()` (around line 147)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Find input to `get_epoch_schedule` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `get_epoch_schedule` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `get_epoch_schedule` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can submit a transaction whose loading, sanitization, ALT resolution, or execution result differs between honest validators, causing bank-hash divergence, a fork, or an unbootable ledger replay.
