# Q2497: validate_auth_callback — no replay window via chosen state cookie

## Question
Trace `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route with the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely: because nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely
- Exploit idea: nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
