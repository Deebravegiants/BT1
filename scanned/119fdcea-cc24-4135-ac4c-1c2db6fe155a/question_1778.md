# Q1778: auth_base_uri — private-app guard ordering via duplicated query keys

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Oauth.auth_base_uri` through the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator` while supplying repeated `shop=`/`state=` keys where the framework's last-wins parse differs from the value that was signed, so that `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: repeated `shop=`/`state=` keys where the framework's last-wins parse differs from the value that was signed
- Exploit idea: `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
