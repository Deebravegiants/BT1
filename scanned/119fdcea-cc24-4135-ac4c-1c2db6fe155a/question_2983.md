# Q2983: initialize — rewrite is textual via headers override

## Question
Starting from `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `headers:` hash that reaches `extra_headers` and is merged over the client's defaults so that the `.json` strip/append is a regex rewrite on a string that may already contain a query or fragment? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`, and whether the result reaches High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch
- Attacker controls: a `headers:` hash that reaches `extra_headers` and is merged over the client's defaults
- Exploit idea: the `.json` strip/append is a regex rewrite on a string that may already contain a query or fragment
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
