# Q2718: total-debt via liquidate-redeem: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the borrower targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `total-debt` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
