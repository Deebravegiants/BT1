# Q546: initialize — no operation policy via variables hash

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Graphql::Client#initialize` through `Graphql::Client.new(session:, base_path:, api_version:)` and its version-override branch while supplying the `variables` hash, serialised into the request body, so that no distinction between queries and mutations, and no scope check against the session, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/graphql/client.rb` -> `Clients::Graphql::Client#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Graphql::Client.new(session:, base_path:, api_version:)` and its version-override branch
- Attacker controls: the `variables` hash, serialised into the request body
- Exploit idea: no distinction between queries and mutations, and no scope check against the session
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: pass a crafted `api_version` and assert the recorded path stays within the configured version
