# Q2838: send-underlying via liquidate-redeem: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the borrower targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the borrower targeted across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `send-underlying` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
