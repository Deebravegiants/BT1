# Q2569: inspector normalize_type_tag cross-request aliasing lets one

## Question
Can an unprivileged bridge user submitting a malicious foreign-chain transaction or proof payload enter through `verify_foreign_transaction` and use the chosen chain/domain, transaction identifier, proof bytes, event/log shape, repeated submissions, and replay timing to drive the code path through `crates/foreign-chain-inspector/src/aptos/inspector.rs::normalize_type_tag` so that cross-request aliasing lets one operation resolve, overwrite, or consume another, breaking the invariant that one externally created operation must map to exactly one internal request record and exactly one completion path, and leading to Unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: crates/foreign-chain-inspector/src/aptos/inspector.rs:189::normalize_type_tag
- Entrypoint: `verify_foreign_transaction`
- Attacker controls: the chosen chain/domain, transaction identifier, proof bytes, event/log shape, repeated submissions, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: cross-request aliasing lets one operation resolve, overwrite, or consume another
- Invariant to test: one externally created operation must map to exactly one internal request record and exactly one completion path
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: build two requests that differ in security-relevant fields, trace the hash/key path, and check whether one completion resolves both records or the wrong record
