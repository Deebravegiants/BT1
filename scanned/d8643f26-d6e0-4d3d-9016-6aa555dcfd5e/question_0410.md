# Q410: rpc manager stale session reuse via handles

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge and control `params`, `port`, and `name` so that `handles` in `libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/rpc-manager.js` make malformed input fail open and select a dangerous default path instead of being rejected, breaking the invariant that origin/session bindings must remain one-to-one across RPC requests, responses, and subscriptions, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/rpc-manager.js::handles
- Entrypoint: connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge
- Attacker controls: two concurrent port sessions, reused request IDs, and response ordering
- Exploit idea: make malformed input fail open and select a dangerous default path instead of being rejected
- Invariant to test: origin/session bindings must remain one-to-one across RPC requests, responses, and subscriptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: fuzz malformed RPC payloads and verify the bridge rejects them before any wallet-mutating method is reached
