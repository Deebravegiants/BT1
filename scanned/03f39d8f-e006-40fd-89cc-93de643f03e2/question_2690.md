# Q2690: inspector extract_value a one-time artifact can

## Question
Can an unprivileged bridge user submitting a malicious foreign-chain transaction or proof payload enter through `verify_foreign_transaction` and use the chosen chain/domain, transaction identifier, proof bytes, event/log shape, repeated submissions, and replay timing to drive the code path through `crates/foreign-chain-inspector/src/starknet/inspector.rs::extract_value` so that a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime, breaking the invariant that completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch, and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: crates/foreign-chain-inspector/src/starknet/inspector.rs:141::extract_value
- Entrypoint: `verify_foreign_transaction`
- Attacker controls: the chosen chain/domain, transaction identifier, proof bytes, event/log shape, repeated submissions, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime
- Invariant to test: completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: force a retry or restart boundary, then resend the old artifact and verify whether it still affects request resolution or signature completion
