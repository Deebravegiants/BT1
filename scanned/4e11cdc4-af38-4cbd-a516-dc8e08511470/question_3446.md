# Q3446: accrue-user-debts via redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-debts` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
