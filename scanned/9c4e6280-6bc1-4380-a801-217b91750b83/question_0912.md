# Q0912: get_heap can be driven into unbounded work (mem_pool.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_heap` in `program-runtime/src/mem_pool.rs` with an index range the attacker can grow without bound, and make `get_heap` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `get_heap` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/mem_pool.rs` -> `get_heap()` (around line 136)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an index range the attacker can grow without bound
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `get_heap` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `get_heap` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `get_heap` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can send a valid-looking transaction that panics, overflows, aborts, or wedges banking/replay on every node, halting consensus until human intervention.
