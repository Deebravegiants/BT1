# Q1731: get-available-assets via liquidate-redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-available-assets` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
