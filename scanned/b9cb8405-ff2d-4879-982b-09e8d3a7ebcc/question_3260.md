# Q3260: process — dispatch on unauthenticated data via replayed delivery

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Registry.process` from `ShopifyAPI::Webhooks::Registry.process(request)`, the entry point of every app's public webhook route with the same signed body and `webhook-id` delivered repeatedly: because the handler is selected by `request.topic`, a header the HMAC does not cover, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.process`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Webhooks::Registry.process(request)`, the entry point of every app's public webhook route
- Attacker controls: the same signed body and `webhook-id` delivered repeatedly
- Exploit idea: the handler is selected by `request.topic`, a header the HMAC does not cover
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: register two handlers, submit one signed body with each topic header, and assert dispatch follows the signature rather than the header
