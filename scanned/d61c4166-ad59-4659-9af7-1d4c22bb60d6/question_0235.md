# Q235: unified_admin? — nil-safe guard skipped via trailing-dot host

## Question
Can a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`, make `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
