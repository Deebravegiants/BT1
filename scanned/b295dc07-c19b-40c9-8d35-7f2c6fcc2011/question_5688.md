# Q5688: get_path — read-only filter applied late via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
Can nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids, make `Rest::Base.get_path` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
