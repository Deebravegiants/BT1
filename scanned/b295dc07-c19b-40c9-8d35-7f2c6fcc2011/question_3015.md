# Q3015: request — response content into logs via deprecation header

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpClient#request` from `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request with an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim: because response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
