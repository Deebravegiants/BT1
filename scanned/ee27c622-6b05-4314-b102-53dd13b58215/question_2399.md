# Q2399: accrue-user-debts via collateral-remove: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
