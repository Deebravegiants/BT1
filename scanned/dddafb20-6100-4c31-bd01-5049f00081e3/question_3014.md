# Q3014: current_session_id — interpolation collision via shop with underscore

## Question
Can a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves, make `SessionUtils.current_session_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.current_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves
- Attacker controls: a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key
- Exploit idea: string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
