# Q3956: find-superset via liquidate: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering reach `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `liquidate` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering varied, and assert that the value `find-superset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
