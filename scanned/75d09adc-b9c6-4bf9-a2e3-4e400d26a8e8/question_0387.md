# Q0387: price-resolve via collateral-remove-redeem: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
`price-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373) resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), by choosing `min-underlying`, use that to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, violating the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373` -> `price-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `price-resolve` resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `price-resolve` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
