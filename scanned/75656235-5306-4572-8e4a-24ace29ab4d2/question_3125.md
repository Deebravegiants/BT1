# Q3125: update_accounts_for_successful_tx confuses account types or owners (account_loader.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `update_accounts_for_successful_tx` in `svm/src/account_loader.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and have `update_accounts_for_successful_tx` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`update_accounts_for_successful_tx` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `svm/src/account_loader.rs` -> `update_accounts_for_successful_tx()` (around line 309)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `update_accounts_for_successful_tx` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `update_accounts_for_successful_tx` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `update_accounts_for_successful_tx` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft a transaction whose fee, rent, rollback, or balance-commit accounting in the SVM lifecycle moves, mints, duplicates, or destroys lamports the signer does not own.
