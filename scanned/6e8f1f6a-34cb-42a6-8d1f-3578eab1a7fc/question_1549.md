# Q1549: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-add: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) — which expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64 — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `mask-to-list-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
