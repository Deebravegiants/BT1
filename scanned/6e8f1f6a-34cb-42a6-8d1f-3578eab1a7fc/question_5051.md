# Q5051: add-user-scaled-debt via borrow: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`add-user-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237) adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:237` -> `add-user-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `add-user-scaled-debt` adds to the scaled debt row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `borrow` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `price-feeds` buffers, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
