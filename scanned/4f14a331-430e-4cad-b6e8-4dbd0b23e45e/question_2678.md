# Q2678: refresh_token_expired? — identity built by interpolation via online/offline flip

## Question
Can an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil, make `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?`
- Entrypoint: `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?`
- Exploit idea: session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
