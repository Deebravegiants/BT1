# Q5018: set_property — method shadowing via ids hash

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path at `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, makes `Rest::Base#set_property` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
