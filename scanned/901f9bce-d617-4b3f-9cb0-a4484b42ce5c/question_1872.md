# Q1872: activate_session — rotation window unbounded via api_version string

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `api_version` string, which becomes a directory path in `load_rest_resources` to `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`, does `Context.activate_session` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because nothing ever clears `old_api_secret_key`? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.activate_session`
- Entrypoint: `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`
- Attacker controls: the `api_version` string, which becomes a directory path in `load_rest_resources`
- Exploit idea: nothing ever clears `old_api_secret_key`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: run two threads through `Session.temp` and assert neither observes the other's active session
