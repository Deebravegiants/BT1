# Q2123: connections auto-approve confusion via setFavorite

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website and manipulate `accounts`, `icon`, and request ordering so that `setFavorite` in `features/connected-origins/module/connections.js` make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket, breaking the invariant that string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context, and leading to `Sitewide disruption of core services`?

## Target
- File/function: features/connected-origins/module/connections.js::setFavorite
- Entrypoint: wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website
- Attacker controls: a request that mixes canonical and non-canonical origin forms, ports, or host spellings
- Exploit idea: make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket
- Invariant to test: string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Sitewide disruption of core services
- Fast validation: unit-test canonical and non-canonical origin forms and verify they never share trust or auto-approve state unexpectedly
