# Q3171: create_instance — read-only filter applied late via pagination cursors

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Rest::Base.create_instance` through `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)` while supplying `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request, so that the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.create_instance`
- Entrypoint: `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`
- Attacker controls: `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
