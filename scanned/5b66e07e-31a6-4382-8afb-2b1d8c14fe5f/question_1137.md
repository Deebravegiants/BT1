# Q1137: parsed_body — shop handed to handler unverified via http_ prefix stripping

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a header literally named `http_shopify-topic`, whose `sub("http_","")` rewrite creates a second claimant for one key to `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification, does `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch? Close the question on BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body`
- Entrypoint: `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification
- Attacker controls: a header literally named `http_shopify-topic`, whose `sub("http_","")` rewrite creates a second claimant for one key
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
