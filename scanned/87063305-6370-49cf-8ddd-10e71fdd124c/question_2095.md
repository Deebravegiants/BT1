# Q2095: connected origins permission scope widening via createConnectedOriginsAtom

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website and manipulate `port`, `port`, and request ordering so that `createConnectedOriginsAtom` in `features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-origins.js` keep stale connected-account or address-cache data alive across seed rotation, restore, or account changes, breaking the invariant that origin trust and auto-approve state must be keyed by a canonical origin and the intended wallet account, and leading to `Sitewide disruption of core services`?

## Target
- File/function: features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-origins.js::createConnectedOriginsAtom
- Entrypoint: wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website
- Attacker controls: the origin string, wallet-account name, and the sequence of connect / sign / auto-approve actions
- Exploit idea: keep stale connected-account or address-cache data alive across seed rotation, restore, or account changes
- Invariant to test: origin trust and auto-approve state must be keyed by a canonical origin and the intended wallet account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Sitewide disruption of core services
- Fast validation: unit-test canonical and non-canonical origin forms and verify they never share trust or auto-approve state unexpectedly
