# Q1518: erc191 nonce via a pre-signed `MultiP token_diff

## Question
For standard `erc191` (`IntentSignerViem.signIntent`; `payload` = JSON of {signer_id, verifying_contract, deadline, nonce, intents}), can an unprivileged caller alter `nonce` (the 32-byte replay guard (versioned salted nonce)) via a pre-signed `MultiPayload` passed in `signedIntents.before` / `.after`, given composed payloads are published atomically without inspection, so that a `token_diff` intent (`diff` map from `feeEstimation.quote`, `referral`) is signed and published under a `nonce` the SDK user did not intend, and intents.near accepts it because the signature still verifies over the altered payload?

## Target
- File/function: packages/intents-sdk/src/intents/intent-executer-impl/intent-executer.ts `signAndSendIntent`, `mergeIntentPayloads`, `composeMultiPayloads`; intent-payload-builder.ts; intent-payload-factory.ts; intent-signer-impl/*
- Entrypoint: `IntentsSDK.signAndSendIntent` / `intentBuilder()` / `sendSignedIntents`
- Attacker controls: `nonce` through via a pre-signed `MultiPayload` passed in `signedIntents.before` / `.after`; the `token_diff` intent body
- Exploit idea: composed payloads are published atomically without inspection. For `erc191` the signed bytes are `computeSignedErc191Hash` (keccak256 of `\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\n<len>` + payload).
- Invariant to test: signed.nonce == the value the caller constructed; for `intents`, the multiset of intents signed equals the multiset added (no reference-dedup collapse, no reorder).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signature bound to the wrong contract, signer or nonce (HackenProof: intent signing and verification, nonce management)
- Fast validation: vitest: use a `erc191` signer with a recording `signMessage`, apply the manipulation, decode the signed payload and diff every field.
