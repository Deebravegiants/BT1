# Q0440: iter-lookup-debt via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `iter-lookup-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:218` -> `iter-lookup-debt`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `iter-lookup-debt` skips rows failing `relevant`, so a disabled asset's DEBT vanishes from the returned position. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `iter-lookup-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
