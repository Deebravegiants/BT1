# Q4110: unpack-u16 via accrue: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, can an unprivileged attacker make `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `accrue` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `unpack-u16` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
