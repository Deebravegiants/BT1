# Q420: proxy_query — normalisation collision via mutation document

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `GraphqlProxy.proxy_query` through `ShopifyAPI::Utils::GraphqlProxy.proxy_query(session:, headers:, body:, cookies:, tries:)`, wired by apps to a browser-reachable proxy route while supplying a mutation rather than a query, since nothing distinguishes reads from writes, so that two different inbound header names normalise to one key, and which value survives depends on hash ordering, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/graphql_proxy.rb` -> `GraphqlProxy.proxy_query`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::GraphqlProxy.proxy_query(session:, headers:, body:, cookies:, tries:)`, wired by apps to a browser-reachable proxy route
- Attacker controls: a mutation rather than a query, since nothing distinguishes reads from writes
- Exploit idea: two different inbound header names normalise to one key, and which value survives depends on hash ordering
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: post a mutation document through `proxy_query` and assert the recorded upstream request carried the merchant's token
