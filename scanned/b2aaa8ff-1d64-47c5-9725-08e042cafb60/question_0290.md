# Q0290: oracle-timestamp-fresh via liquidate-redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-timestamp-fresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365) mint shares whose backing was never received? `oracle-timestamp-fresh` sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:365` -> `oracle-timestamp-fresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `oracle-timestamp-fresh` sets `delta` to u0 whenever `ts` exceeds `stacks-block-time`, so a future timestamp is maximally fresh, then requires `(>= ts prev)`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `oracle-timestamp-fresh` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
