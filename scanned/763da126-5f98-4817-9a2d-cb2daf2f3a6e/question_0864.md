# Q864: proxy_query — caller document executed verbatim via content-type with parameters

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a `content-type` such as `application/json; charset=utf-8`, which matches neither literal branch to `ShopifyAPI::Utils::GraphqlProxy.proxy_query(session:, headers:, body:, cookies:, tries:)`, wired by apps to a browser-reachable proxy route, does `GraphqlProxy.proxy_query` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the document reaches `Clients::Graphql::Admin#query` unchanged, with the merchant's access token attached? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/graphql_proxy.rb` -> `GraphqlProxy.proxy_query`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::GraphqlProxy.proxy_query(session:, headers:, body:, cookies:, tries:)`, wired by apps to a browser-reachable proxy route
- Attacker controls: a `content-type` such as `application/json; charset=utf-8`, which matches neither literal branch
- Exploit idea: the document reaches `Clients::Graphql::Admin#query` unchanged, with the merchant's access token attached
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: post a mutation document through `proxy_query` and assert the recorded upstream request carried the merchant's token
