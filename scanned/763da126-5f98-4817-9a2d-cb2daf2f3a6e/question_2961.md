# Q2961: initialize — rewrite is textual via traversal to another version

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize` through `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch while supplying `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure, so that the `.json` strip/append is a regex rewrite on a string that may already contain a query or fragment, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch
- Attacker controls: `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure
- Exploit idea: the `.json` strip/append is a regex rewrite on a string that may already contain a query or fragment
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `get(path: 'admin/oauth/access_token')` and assert the recorded URI, then assert the access token was not sent to it
