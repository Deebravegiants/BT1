# Q2821: process — shared mutable registry via unsigned topic header

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Registry.process` through `ShopifyAPI::Webhooks::Registry.process(request)`, the entry point of every app's public webhook route while supplying the topic, taken from an unsigned header, used both to select the handler and to build GraphQL documents, so that `@registry` is process-global and mutable at runtime, so what a topic maps to can change between verification and dispatch, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.process`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Webhooks::Registry.process(request)`, the entry point of every app's public webhook route
- Attacker controls: the topic, taken from an unsigned header, used both to select the handler and to build GraphQL documents
- Exploit idea: `@registry` is process-global and mutable at runtime, so what a topic maps to can change between verification and dispatch
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `WebhookMetadata#shop` cannot differ from a shop authenticated by the request
