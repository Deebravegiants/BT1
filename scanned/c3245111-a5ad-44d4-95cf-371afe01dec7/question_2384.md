# Q2384: cookie_session_id — no shop cross-check via empty token

## Question
Can an empty or whitespace `shopify_id_token`, exercising the `MissingJwtTokenError` boundary versus the cookie fallback, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key, make `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: an empty or whitespace `shopify_id_token`, exercising the `MissingJwtTokenError` boundary versus the cookie fallback
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
