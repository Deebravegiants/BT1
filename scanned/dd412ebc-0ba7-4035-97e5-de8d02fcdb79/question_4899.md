# Q4899: sanitize_shop_domain — dev-domain entries reachable in production via embedded port

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a shop string carrying an explicit port such as `victim.myshopify.com:8443` or `myshopify.com:80@evil.example` at a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`, makes `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a shop string carrying an explicit port such as `victim.myshopify.com:8443` or `myshopify.com:80@evil.example`
- Exploit idea: `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
