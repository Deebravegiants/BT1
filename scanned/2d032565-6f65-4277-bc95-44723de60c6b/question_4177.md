# Q4177: initialize — unanchored substitution via non-Shopify dest

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#initialize` from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header with a `dest` naming a host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, since `JwtPayload` never calls `ShopValidator`: because `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: a `dest` naming a host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, since `JwtPayload` never calls `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
