# Q3814: post — version chosen per call via case-varied prefix

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a path beginning with `Admin/` or `/admin/`, probing the exact `start_with?("admin/")` comparison after the leading-slash strip at `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token, makes `Clients::Rest::Admin#post` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#post`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token
- Attacker controls: a path beginning with `Admin/` or `/admin/`, probing the exact `start_with?("admin/")` comparison after the leading-slash strip
- Exploit idea: the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
