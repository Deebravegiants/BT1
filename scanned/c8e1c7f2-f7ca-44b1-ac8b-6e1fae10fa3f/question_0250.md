# Q250: temp — equality omits the token via caller-supplied id

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session.temp` from `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block with the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key: because `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.temp`
- Entrypoint: `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block
- Attacker controls: the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key
- Exploit idea: `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `expired?` is true, not false, for a session with no expiry once its token is past any plausible lifetime
