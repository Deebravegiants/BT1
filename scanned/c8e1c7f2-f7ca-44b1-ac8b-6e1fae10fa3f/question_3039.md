# Q3039: to_hash — path interpolation from ids via primary key value

## Question
Starting from `to_hash(saving)`, which walks `instance_variables` and filters `read_only_attributes`, can an unprivileged attacker supply the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path so that ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Rest::Base#to_hash`, and whether the result reaches High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#to_hash`
- Entrypoint: `to_hash(saving)`, which walks `instance_variables` and filters `read_only_attributes`
- Attacker controls: the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path
- Exploit idea: ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
