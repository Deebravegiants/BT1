# Q3844: make_request — prefix re-rooting via api_version override

## Question
Starting from the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`, can an unprivileged attacker supply an `api_version:` argument derived from request input, changing the base path and the loaded resource classes so that the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: an `api_version:` argument derived from request input, changing the base path and the loaded resource classes
- Exploit idea: the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
