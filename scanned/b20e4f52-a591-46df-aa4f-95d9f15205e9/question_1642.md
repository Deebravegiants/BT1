# Q1642: make_request — prefix re-rooting via traversal to another version

## Question
Can `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`, make `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure
- Exploit idea: the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
