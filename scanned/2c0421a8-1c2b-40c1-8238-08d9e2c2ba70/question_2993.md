# Q2993: request — host header split from connection host via response-driven retry

## Question
Can a 429 or 500 response with a chosen `retry-after` header, steering the retry loop, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, make `Clients::HttpClient#request` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a 429 or 500 response with a chosen `retry-after` header, steering the retry loop
- Exploit idea: when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
