# Q0354: interpolate-rate via repay: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `interpolate-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196) mint shares whose backing was never received? `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:196` -> `interpolate-rate`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `interpolate-rate` interpolates between packed u16 curve points. Reach it through `repay` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `on-behalf-of`, naming any third-party principal across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `interpolate-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
