# Q3546: send-tokens via borrow: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `borrow` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `send-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
