# Q1296: begin_auth — HMAC precedes but does not bind via attacker-signed callback

## Question
Starting from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app so that `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Oauth.begin_auth`, and whether the result reaches High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app
- Exploit idea: `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `begin_auth(shop: 'a.myshopify.com')`, then `validate_auth_callback` with a validly signed query naming shop B, and assert the returned `session.shop`
