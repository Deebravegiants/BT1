# Q5540: request_url — dev-mode rewrite in production via empty access token

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response to the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, does `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
