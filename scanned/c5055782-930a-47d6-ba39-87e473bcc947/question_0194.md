# Q0194: unpack-u16 via accrue: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, can an unprivileged attacker make `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) mint shares whose backing was never received? `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `accrue` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the utilization the rate is interpolated at varied, and assert that the value `unpack-u16` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
