# Q1708: unpack-u16 via collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
