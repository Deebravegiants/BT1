# Q2443: pubkey: resource starvation

## Question
In `gossip/src/contact_info.rs`, can an unprivileged attacker who can flood the public entrypoint with unprivileged traffic unprivileged traffic through `pubkey` (near line 250) monopolize connection slots/bandwidth/scheduler time and starve honest peers, breaking the invariant that honest peers keep a fair share of connection/bandwidth/scheduler resources, corrupting the connection-slot / bandwidth / scheduler share left for honest peers?

## Target
- File/function: `gossip/src/contact_info.rs` :: `pubkey` (around line 250)
- Entrypoint: Gossip protocol ingest (CRDS push/pull over UDP) — attacker can flood the public entrypoint with unprivileged traffic
- Attacker controls: gossip message bytes, CRDS values, wallclock, and pull-request filters
- Exploit idea: Can unprivileged traffic through `pubkey` (near line 250) monopolize connection slots/bandwidth/scheduler time and starve honest peers, so that the connection-slot / bandwidth / scheduler share left for honest peers is set to an attacker-chosen or inconsistent value.
- Invariant to test: honest peers keep a fair share of connection/bandwidth/scheduler resources
- Expected Immunefi impact: High. Unprivileged transaction, gossip, or QUIC traffic can starve honest peers of connection slots, stake-weighted bandwidth, scheduler capacity, or thread-pool time, blocking legitimate transactions from ever being included.
- Fast validation: add a focused Rust unit/fuzz test on `pubkey` in `gossip/src/contact_info.rs` measuring honest-request latency under an unprivileged flood.
