# Q4379: expired? — copy preserves the key via copy across identities

## Question
Can a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil, make `Auth::Session#expired?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#expired?`
- Entrypoint: `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`
- Exploit idea: `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
