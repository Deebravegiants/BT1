# Q2764: host_name — global identity, per-request requests via rest_disabled

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises at `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`, makes `Context.host_name` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that one process-wide `Context` serves every shop, so any leakage between requests crosses a tenant boundary? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.host_name`
- Entrypoint: `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`
- Attacker controls: the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises
- Exploit idea: one process-wide `Context` serves every shop, so any leakage between requests crosses a tenant boundary
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `activate_session` is cleared at the end of a request cycle so a pooled thread cannot serve a stale tenant
