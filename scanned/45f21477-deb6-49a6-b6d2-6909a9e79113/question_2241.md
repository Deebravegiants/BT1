# Q2241: price-multi-resolve via collateral-remove-redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, drive `price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) — which folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `price-multi-resolve` touches, run `collateral-remove-redeem` with `receiver` for the underlying leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
