# Q1927: request_url — version chosen per call via traversal to another version

## Question
Does `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure at the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/`? Show that the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer, that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host is violated, and that the consequence is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/`
- Attacker controls: `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure
- Exploit idea: the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
