# Q2358: jwt_session_id — no shop cross-check via shop casing

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a shop value differing only in case or trailing dot from the stored key, since keys are compared as raw strings at `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation, makes `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a shop value differing only in case or trailing dot from the stored key, since keys are compared as raw strings
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
