# Q5816: parsed_body — header collision via duplicate JSON keys

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a body containing a repeated JSON key, where the signed bytes and the `JSON.parse` result disagree about which value wins at `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification, makes `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup? Test SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body`
- Entrypoint: `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification
- Attacker controls: a body containing a repeated JSON key, where the signed bytes and the `JSON.parse` result disagree about which value wins
- Exploit idea: two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: sign one body with the test secret, POST it twice with different `x-shopify-shop-domain` values, assert the handler receives two different shops for one signature
