# Q3500: mask-to-list-collateral via supply-collateral-add: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to reach `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to varied, and assert that the value `mask-to-list-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
