# Q716: callback_address — regex injection via topic string

## Question
Does `Registrations::Http#callback_address` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted at `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`? Show that an unescaped interpolation into a `Regexp` changes what the match accepts, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted
- Exploit idea: an unescaped interpolation into a `Regexp` changes what the match accepts
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a regex-metacharacter host name does not widen what `callback_address` accepts
