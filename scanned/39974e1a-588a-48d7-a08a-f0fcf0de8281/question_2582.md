# Q2582: from — nil means valid via shop with separator

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair at `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`, makes `Auth::Session.from` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.from`
- Entrypoint: `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`
- Attacker controls: a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair
- Exploit idea: `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
