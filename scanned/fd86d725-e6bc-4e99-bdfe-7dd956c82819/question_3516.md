# Q3516: debt-preview via collateral-remove-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `debt-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
