# Q3555: post — caller headers win via traversal to another version

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure at `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token, makes `Clients::Rest::Admin#post` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#post`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token
- Attacker controls: `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `get(path: 'admin/oauth/access_token')` and assert the recorded URI, then assert the access token was not sent to it
