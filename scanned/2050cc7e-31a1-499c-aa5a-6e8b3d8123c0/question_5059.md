# Q5059: unified_admin? — dev-domain entries reachable in production via IDN / Unicode label

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` from the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin` with a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip`: because `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip`
- Exploit idea: `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
