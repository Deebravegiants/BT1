# Q3579: Reward sniping via ping under many account epoch boundary dust threshold

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker position around reward settlement by using `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping()` with sixteen attacker EOAs splitting the same total capital into many dust positions, the attacker straddles an epoch transition where the pool has a small positive reward to settle, and dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding, so rewards recognized inside `internal_ping()` are attributed to the wrong share snapshot and the attacker captures value that should belong to earlier stakers?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping` and reward distribution into `total_staked_balance` / `total_stake_shares` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping`, `last_total_balance`, `total_staked_balance`, and `total_stake_shares`
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping()`
- Attacker controls: when `ping()` is triggered, how often it is repeated, what attacker position exists before it, and whether a victim position is already live; sixteen attacker EOAs splitting the same total capital into many dust positions; the attacker straddles an epoch transition where the pool has a small positive reward to settle; dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding
- Exploit idea: Exploit the fact that reward settlement ordering, `last_total_balance`, owner-fee minting, and third-party-triggered state changes depends on when public calls trigger `internal_ping()` relative to stake ownership changes.
- Invariant to test: Rewards must accrue only to stake that was already economically at risk before the rewarded epoch; public settlement timing must not let a late entrant capture prior rewards.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Simulate a victim pre-stake, then vary whether `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping()` occurs before or after the epoch change; compare attacker reward share against the fair baseline.
