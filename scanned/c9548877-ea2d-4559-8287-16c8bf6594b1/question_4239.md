# Q4239: shopify_user_id — type assumptions via iss/dest mismatch

## Question
Can a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, make `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares
- Exploit idea: `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
