# Q5592: request_url — host header split from connection host via extra_headers

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling `extra_headers` merged after the base headers, able to override `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, `Host` or `Content-Type` at the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, makes `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: `extra_headers` merged after the base headers, able to override `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, `Host` or `Content-Type`
- Exploit idea: when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
