# Q3511: convert-to-assets-preview via supply-collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, then read `convert-to-assets-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
