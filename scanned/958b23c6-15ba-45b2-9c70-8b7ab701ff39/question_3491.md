# Q3491: add_registration — shared mutable registry via webhook_id from a response

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Registry.add_registration` from `add_registration(topic:, delivery_method:, path:, handler:, fields:, filter:, metafield_namespaces:)` with a `webhook_id` taken from an upstream response and interpolated directly into the delete mutation string: because `@registry` is process-global and mutable at runtime, so what a topic maps to can change between verification and dispatch, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.add_registration`
- Entrypoint: `add_registration(topic:, delivery_method:, path:, handler:, fields:, filter:, metafield_namespaces:)`
- Attacker controls: a `webhook_id` taken from an upstream response and interpolated directly into the delete mutation string
- Exploit idea: `@registry` is process-global and mutable at runtime, so what a topic maps to can change between verification and dispatch
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay one signed delivery twice and assert the handler is invoked at most once per `webhook-id`
