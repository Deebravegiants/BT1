# Q5937: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-add: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, drive `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) — which scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path — to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, breaking the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-add` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `convert-to-scaled-debt` touches, run `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
