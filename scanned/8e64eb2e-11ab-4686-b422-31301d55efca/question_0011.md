# Q0011: accrue-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
`accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, violating the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
