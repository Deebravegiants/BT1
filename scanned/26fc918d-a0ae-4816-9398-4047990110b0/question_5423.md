# Q5423: create_instance — cursor trusted via primary key value

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.create_instance` from `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)` with the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path: because page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.create_instance`
- Entrypoint: `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`
- Attacker controls: the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
