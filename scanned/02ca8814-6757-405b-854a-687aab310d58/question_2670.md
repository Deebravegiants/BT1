# Q2670: prune_unstaked_connection_table panics on attacker-reachable input (swqos.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `prune_unstaked_connection_table` in `streamer/src/nonblocking/swqos.rs` with an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction, and reach an unchecked unwrap, slice index, or assertion inside `prune_unstaked_connection_table`, so that the invariant "No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/nonblocking/swqos.rs` -> `prune_unstaked_connection_table()` (around line 241)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: an instruction sequence that re-enters the same code path within one transaction
- Exploit idea: Reach `prune_unstaked_connection_table` with input that trips an unwrap, slice index, `expect`, division, or debug assertion, aborting the process on every node that replays the block.
- Invariant to test: No attacker-reachable input causes a panic, abort, or assertion failure; failures are returned as errors.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Fuzz `prune_unstaked_connection_table` with `cargo fuzz`/proptest over its attacker-controlled arguments; assert no panic, only `Result::Err`.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can send a valid-looking transaction that panics, overflows, aborts, or wedges banking/replay on every node, halting consensus until human intervention.
