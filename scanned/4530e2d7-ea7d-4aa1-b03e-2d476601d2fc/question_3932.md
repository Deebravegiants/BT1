# Q3932: find-and-resolve-asset-value via collateral-remove-redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `find-and-resolve-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:668` -> `find-and-resolve-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `find-and-resolve-asset-value` reuses an already-resolved price from the asset list and returns u0 when the asset is not found. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `find-and-resolve-asset-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
