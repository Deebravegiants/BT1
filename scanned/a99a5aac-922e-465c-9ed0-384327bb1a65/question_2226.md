# Q2226: append_first_party_development_headers — string interpolation, not URL joining via session.shop

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` through `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev` while supplying `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`, so that the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
