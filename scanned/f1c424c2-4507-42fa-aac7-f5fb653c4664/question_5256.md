# Q5256: user-safe-mask via collateral-remove: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `user-safe-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:428` -> `user-safe-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `user-safe-mask` ANDs the user's collateral bits against the enabled bitmap but keeps ALL debt bits unfiltered. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `user-safe-mask` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
