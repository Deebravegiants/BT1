# Q6: shop — claim trusted as identity via sub variants

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `sub` claim that is absent, non-numeric, negative, zero-padded, or huge, changing `user_id_sub?` and the `#{shop}_#{sub}` key at `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`, makes `JwtPayload#shop` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: a `sub` claim that is absent, non-numeric, negative, zero-padded, or huge, changing `user_id_sub?` and the `#{shop}_#{sub}` key
- Exploit idea: a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
