# Q4343: shopify_user_id — no iss/dest binding via own-shop id token

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a genuine session token issued to the attacker's own shop, signed with the same `api_secret_key` that serves every install of the app to `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, does `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a genuine session token issued to the attacker's own shop, signed with the same `api_secret_key` that serves every install of the app
- Exploit idea: the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
