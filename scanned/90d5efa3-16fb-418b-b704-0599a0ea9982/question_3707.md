# Q3707: temp — copy preserves the key via online/offline flip

## Question
Can an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block, make `Auth::Session.temp` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.temp`
- Entrypoint: `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block
- Attacker controls: an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?`
- Exploit idea: `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
