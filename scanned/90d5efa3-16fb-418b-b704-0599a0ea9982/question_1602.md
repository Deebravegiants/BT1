# Q1602: auth_base_uri — HMAC precedes but does not bind via chosen state cookie

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely at the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`, makes `Oauth.auth_base_uri` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization? Test SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely
- Exploit idea: `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
