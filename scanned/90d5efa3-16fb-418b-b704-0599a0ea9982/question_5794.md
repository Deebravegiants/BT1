# Q5794: trusted_domains — shop name reconstructed, not validated via nested host in path

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` from `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only with a unified-admin URL whose last path segment is itself a hostname, e.g. `https://admin.shopify.com/store/evil.example`: because the returned `"#{shop}.myshopify.com"` is manufactured by string concatenation and never re-validated, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a unified-admin URL whose last path segment is itself a hostname, e.g. `https://admin.shopify.com/store/evil.example`
- Exploit idea: the returned `"#{shop}.myshopify.com"` is manufactured by string concatenation and never re-validated
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
