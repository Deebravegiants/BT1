# Q5630: create via repay: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `repay` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
