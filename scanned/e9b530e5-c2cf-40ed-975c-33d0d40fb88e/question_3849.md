# Q3849: total-debt via accrue: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, drive `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index` — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `accrue` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-debt` touches, run `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
