# Q3133: generate remote config url unsafe config merge via generateRemoteConfigUrl

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `config`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `generateRemoteConfigUrl` in `features/remote-config/module/generate-remote-config-url.ts` replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent, violating the invariant that remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context, and leading to `Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction`?

## Target
- File/function: features/remote-config/module/generate-remote-config-url.ts::generateRemoteConfigUrl
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: default-enabled configuration fields that toggle security-sensitive behavior
- Exploit idea: replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent
- Invariant to test: remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction
- Fast validation: unit-test ETag / Last-Modified transitions and verify a required refresh is not skipped when effective policy changed
