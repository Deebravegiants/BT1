# Q1369: request_url — token attached before destination is settled via session.shop

## Question
Can `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, make `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
