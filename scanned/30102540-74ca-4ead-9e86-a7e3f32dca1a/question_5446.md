# Q5446: ubalance via accrue: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, can an unprivileged attacker make `ubalance` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:303` -> `ubalance`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update
- Exploit idea: `ubalance` reads the real underlying balance, which `deposit` and `redeem` never reconcile against the `assets` var. Reach it through `accrue` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with whether an earlier call in the same block already advanced last-update, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
