# Q1206: begin_auth — private-app guard ordering via host parameter

## Question
Does `Oauth.begin_auth` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`? Show that `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself
- Exploit idea: `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
