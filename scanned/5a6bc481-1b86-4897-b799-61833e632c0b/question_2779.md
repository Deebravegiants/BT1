# Q2779: resolve-pyth via supply-collateral-add: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `resolve-pyth` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
