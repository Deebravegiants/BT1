# Q3831: shop — unanchored substitution via leeway window

## Question
Does `JwtPayload#shop` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf` at `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`? Show that `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf`
- Exploit idea: `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
