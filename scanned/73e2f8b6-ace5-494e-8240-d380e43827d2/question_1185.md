# Q1185: resolve via borrow: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) — which selects the efficiency group for a position mask — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `borrow` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve` touches, run `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
