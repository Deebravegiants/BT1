# Q2956: begin_auth — redirect target unbound via private/embedded config

## Question
Does `Oauth.begin_auth` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`? Show that `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself
- Exploit idea: `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `begin_auth(shop: 'a.myshopify.com')`, then `validate_auth_callback` with a validly signed query naming shop B, and assert the returned `session.shop`
