# Q2293: cookie_session_id — caller decides identity shape via guessed online key

## Question
Can a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key, make `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
