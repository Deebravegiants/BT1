# Q2088: connected accounts auto-approve confusion via createConnectedAccountsAtom

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website and manipulate `account`, `accounts`, and request ordering so that `createConnectedAccountsAtom` in `features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-accounts.js` make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket, breaking the invariant that string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context, and leading to `Direct theft of user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-accounts.js::createConnectedAccountsAtom
- Entrypoint: wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website
- Attacker controls: a request that mixes canonical and non-canonical origin forms, ports, or host spellings
- Exploit idea: make canonicalization or coercion collapse two distinct origin/account identities into one permission bucket
- Invariant to test: string coercion or host normalization must not merge distinct authorities or accounts into one authorization context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: simulate two origins and two wallet accounts, approve only one pairing, then replay the other and assert no permission, address, or signature bleeds across
