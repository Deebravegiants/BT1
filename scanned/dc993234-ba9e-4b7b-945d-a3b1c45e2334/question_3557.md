# Q3557: index cache-validator skip via FeeMonitors

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state with crafted `config`, `name`, or stale-state timing so that `FeeMonitors` in `features/fee-data-monitors/monitor/index.js` apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context, violating the invariant that security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/fee-data-monitors/monitor/index.js::FeeMonitors
- Entrypoint: wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state
- Attacker controls: an older-but-well-formed config blob that survives wallet restart or restore
- Exploit idea: apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context
- Invariant to test: security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: load config for one network or account context, switch context, and ensure fee or policy data is not silently reused
