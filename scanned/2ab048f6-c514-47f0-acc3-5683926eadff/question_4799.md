# Q4799: sanitize! — shop name reconstructed, not validated via trailing-dot host

## Question
Can a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`, make `ShopValidator.sanitize!` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the returned `"#{shop}.myshopify.com"` is manufactured by string concatenation and never re-validated? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Entrypoint: `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ
- Exploit idea: the returned `"#{shop}.myshopify.com"` is manufactured by string concatenation and never re-validated
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
