# Q3336: method_missing — query forwarded verbatim via primary key value

## Question
Can the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access, make `Rest::Base#method_missing` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path
- Exploit idea: `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
