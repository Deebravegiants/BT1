# Q30: lib respond mixed request classes bypass

## Question
Can a below-threshold Byzantine participant node acting through an attested responder account enter through `respond` and use the authenticated responder's submitted response object, request body, submission timing, stale local session state, and any replayable MPC artifacts visible before response submission to drive the code path through `crates/contract/src/lib.rs::respond` so that mixed request classes bypass the intended validation or return path, breaking the invariant that request-kind separation must hold across storage, callback wiring, and response resolution, and leading to Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability?

## Target
- File/function: crates/contract/src/lib.rs:564::respond
- Entrypoint: `respond`
- Attacker controls: the authenticated responder's submitted response object, request body, submission timing, stale local session state, and any replayable MPC artifacts visible before response submission
- Exploit idea: mixed request classes bypass the intended validation or return path
- Invariant to test: request-kind separation must hold across storage, callback wiring, and response resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability
- Fast validation: enqueue different request kinds with colliding timing or similar serialized bodies and see whether the wrong resolver accepts the completion
