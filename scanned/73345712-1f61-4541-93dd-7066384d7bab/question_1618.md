# Q1618: vault-accrue via repay: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `repay` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
