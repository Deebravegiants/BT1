# Q2046: connected accounts stale address cache reuse via createConnectedAccountsAtom

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website and manipulate `account`, `accounts`, and request ordering so that `createConnectedAccountsAtom` in `features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-accounts.js` reuse trust, favorite, or auto-approve state from one origin for another origin or another account, breaking the invariant that asset-scope expansion must require explicit user approval for the final returned scope, and leading to `Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction`?

## Target
- File/function: features/connected-origins/atoms/connected-accounts.js::createConnectedAccountsAtom
- Entrypoint: wallet connect / authorize / auto-approve flow from a connected website
- Attacker controls: an address, xpub, or public-key request with attacker-chosen account and asset parameters
- Exploit idea: reuse trust, favorite, or auto-approve state from one origin for another origin or another account
- Invariant to test: asset-scope expansion must require explicit user approval for the final returned scope
- Expected Immunefi impact: Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction
- Fast validation: rotate the seed or switch active accounts after caching addresses or keys and assert stale cache entries are rejected or invalidated
