# Q1655: current_session_id — fallback weakens the strong path via guessed offline key

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint to `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves, does `SessionUtils.current_session_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.current_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
