# Q5147: request — response content into logs via request.path

## Question
Does `Clients::HttpClient#request` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request? Show that response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
