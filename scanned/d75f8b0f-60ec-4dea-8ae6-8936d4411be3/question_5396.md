# Q5396: shopify_user_id — type assumptions via sid claim

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity at `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, makes `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity
- Exploit idea: `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
