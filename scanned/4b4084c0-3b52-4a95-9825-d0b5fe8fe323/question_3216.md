# Q3216: get_webhook_id — tenant identity handed over unverified via webhook_id from a response

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a `webhook_id` taken from an upstream response and interpolated directly into the delete mutation string to `get_webhook_id(topic:, client:)`, which interpolates `topic.gsub(%r{/|\.}, "_").upcase` into a GraphQL document, does `Webhooks::Registry.get_webhook_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value the host app uses to choose whose records to touch? Close the question on SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.get_webhook_id`
- Entrypoint: `get_webhook_id(topic:, client:)`, which interpolates `topic.gsub(%r{/|\.}, "_").upcase` into a GraphQL document
- Attacker controls: a `webhook_id` taken from an upstream response and interpolated directly into the delete mutation string
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value the host app uses to choose whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: register two handlers, submit one signed body with each topic header, and assert dispatch follows the signature rather than the header
