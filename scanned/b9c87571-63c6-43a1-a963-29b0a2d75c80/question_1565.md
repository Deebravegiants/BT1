# Q1565: callback_address — unanchored host match via regex metacharacters in host

## Question
Can a `Context.host_name` containing regex metacharacters, since it is interpolated into a pattern unescaped, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`, make `Registrations::Http#callback_address` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `^#{Context.host_name}` test is a prefix match on an unescaped interpolation, so a look-alike host passes? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: a `Context.host_name` containing regex metacharacters, since it is interpolated into a pattern unescaped
- Exploit idea: the `^#{Context.host_name}` test is a prefix match on an unescaped interpolation, so a look-alike host passes
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a regex-metacharacter host name does not widen what `callback_address` accepts
