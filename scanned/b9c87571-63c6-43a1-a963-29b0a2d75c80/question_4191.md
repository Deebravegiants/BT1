# Q4191: copy_attributes_from — id and shop can disagree via copy across identities

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from` from `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id` with a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`: because `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from`
- Entrypoint: `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id`
- Attacker controls: a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`
- Exploit idea: `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
