# Q3979: convert-to-scaled-debt via collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
`convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), use that to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), then read `convert-to-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
