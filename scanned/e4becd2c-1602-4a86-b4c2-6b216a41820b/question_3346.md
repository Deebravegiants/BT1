# Q3346: make_request — caller headers win via headers override

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request` through the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers` while supplying a `headers:` hash that reaches `extra_headers` and is merged over the client's defaults, so that `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: a `headers:` hash that reaches `extra_headers` and is merged over the client's defaults
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
