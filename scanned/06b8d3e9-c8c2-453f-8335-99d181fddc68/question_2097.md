# Q2097: calc-liq-factor-bound via liquidate-redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, drive `calc-liq-factor-bound` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718) — which scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:718` -> `calc-liq-factor-bound`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-factor-bound` scales the penalty between a min and a max, capped at the max. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-liq-factor-bound` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
