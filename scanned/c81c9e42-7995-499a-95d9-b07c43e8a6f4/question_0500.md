# Q0500: get_prioritization_fees breaks lamport conservation (prioritization_fee_cache.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `get_prioritization_fees` in `runtime/src/prioritization_fee_cache.rs` with a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide, and make the lamports `get_prioritization_fees` removes differ from the lamports it credits, so that the invariant "Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/prioritization_fee_cache.rs` -> `get_prioritization_fees()` (around line 432)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a value large enough that an intermediate product overflows before the final divide
- Exploit idea: Drive `get_prioritization_fees` so the lamports it removes and the lamports it adds differ, minting or destroying value outside the inflation schedule.
- Invariant to test: Sum of lamports before and after the operation is equal, except for the explicit fee/rent burn.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Property test around `get_prioritization_fees`: assert `sum_lamports_before == sum_lamports_after + burned` over randomized inputs.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft a transaction whose fee, rent, rollback, or balance-commit accounting in the SVM lifecycle moves, mints, duplicates, or destroys lamports the signer does not own.
