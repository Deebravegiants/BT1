# Q5588: request — host header split from connection host via query/fragment injection

## Question
Does `Clients::HttpClient#request` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request? Show that when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query
- Exploit idea: when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
