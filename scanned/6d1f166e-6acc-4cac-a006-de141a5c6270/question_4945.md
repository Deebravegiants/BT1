# Q4945: hmac — lossy digest normalisation via duplicate header prefixes

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits both `shopify-topic` and `x-shopify-topic` set to different values, exploiting the `||` preference order to `Request#hmac`, which returns `Digest.hexencode(Base64.decode64(header))` for the `x-shopify-hmac-sha256` header, does `Webhooks::Request#hmac` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `Base64.decode64` is permissive, so many distinct header values collapse to the same compared digest? Close the question on BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#hmac`
- Entrypoint: `Request#hmac`, which returns `Digest.hexencode(Base64.decode64(header))` for the `x-shopify-hmac-sha256` header
- Attacker controls: both `shopify-topic` and `x-shopify-topic` set to different values, exploiting the `||` preference order
- Exploit idea: `Base64.decode64` is permissive, so many distinct header values collapse to the same compared digest
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
