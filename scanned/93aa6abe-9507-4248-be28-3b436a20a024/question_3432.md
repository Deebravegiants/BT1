# Q3432: cookie_session_id — key is predictable via guessed offline key

## Question
Does `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint at `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key? Show that `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information, that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
