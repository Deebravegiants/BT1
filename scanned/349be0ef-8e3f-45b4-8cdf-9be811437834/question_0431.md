# Q0431: accrue-and-cache via liquidate-redeem: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
`accrue-and-cache` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245) keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the vault whose share price the redemption moves, use that to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:245` -> `accrue-and-cache`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `accrue-and-cache` keys `index-cache` on `{timestamp: stacks-block-time, aid}` and returns the cached record forever after, with no invalidation when the vault later moves. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
