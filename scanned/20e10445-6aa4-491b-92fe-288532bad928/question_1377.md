# Q1377: send-tokens via collateral-remove: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), drive `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) — which pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `send-tokens` touches, run `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
