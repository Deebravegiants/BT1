# Q4783: filter-u128 via collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
`filter-u128` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97) filters a 128-entry bucket list. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), use that to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, violating the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:97` -> `filter-u128`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `filter-u128` filters a 128-entry bucket list. Reach it through `collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), then read `filter-u128` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
