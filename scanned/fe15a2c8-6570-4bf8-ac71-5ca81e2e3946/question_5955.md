# Q5955: accrue-user-debts via repay: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
`accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), use that to mint shares whose backing was never received, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `repay` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `accrue-user-debts` touches, run `repay` with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
