# Q2036: get-liquidation-position via collateral-remove-redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver` for the underlying leg reach `get-liquidation-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against, the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:473` -> `get-liquidation-position`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `get-liquidation-position` returns enabled collateral plus ALL debt, a different view from the one borrow validated against. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `receiver` for the underlying leg varied, and assert that the value `get-liquidation-position` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
