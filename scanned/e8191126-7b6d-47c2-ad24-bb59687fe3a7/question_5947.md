# Q5947: trusted_domains — dev-domain entries reachable in production via caller-supplied myshopify_domain

## Question
Can a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only, make `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call
- Exploit idea: `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
