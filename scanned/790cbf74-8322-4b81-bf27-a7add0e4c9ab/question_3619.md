# Q3619: index cross-context fee reuse via resolveFromAddress

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state with crafted `walletAccount`, `assetName`, or stale-state timing so that `resolveFromAddress` in `features/fees/module/index.js` normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard, violating the invariant that cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/fees/module/index.js::resolveFromAddress
- Entrypoint: wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state
- Attacker controls: ETag or Last-Modified transitions combined with repeated load / update calls
- Exploit idea: normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard
- Invariant to test: cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: load config for one network or account context, switch context, and ensure fee or policy data is not silently reused
