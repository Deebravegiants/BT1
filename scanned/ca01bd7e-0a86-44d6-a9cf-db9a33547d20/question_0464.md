# Q464: exchange_token — shop taken from an unvalidated claim via expiring flag

## Question
Does `TokenExchange.exchange_token` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits `Context.expiring_offline_access_tokens`, which changes the body sent and the session's expiry at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token? Show that `dest_shop` comes from `JwtPayload#shop` and is never passed through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, unlike the sibling `migrate_to_expiring_token`, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.exchange_token`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token
- Attacker controls: `Context.expiring_offline_access_tokens`, which changes the body sent and the session's expiry
- Exploit idea: `dest_shop` comes from `JwtPayload#shop` and is never passed through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, unlike the sibling `migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
