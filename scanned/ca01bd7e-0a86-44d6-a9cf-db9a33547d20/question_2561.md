# Q2561: trusted_domains — nil-safe guard skipped via userinfo bypass

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped at `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only, makes `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
