# Q2039: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — parse/resolve divergence via percent-encoded separator

## Question
Does `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments at `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment? Show that what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to, that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments
- Exploit idea: what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
