# Q3174: activate_session — version becomes a path via rest_disabled

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises to `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`, does `Context.activate_session` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.activate_session`
- Entrypoint: `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`
- Attacker controls: the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises
- Exploit idea: `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: run two threads through `Session.temp` and assert neither observes the other's active session
