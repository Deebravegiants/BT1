# Q1558: admin_session_token? — separator collision via dest with embedded separator

## Question
Can a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check, make `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
