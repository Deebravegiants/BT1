# Q881: exchange_token — no consumption tracking via non-embedded / private config

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an app configuration that flips the `Context.private?` and `Context.embedded?` guards at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token, makes `TokenExchange.exchange_token` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a subject token can be exchanged repeatedly within its validity window? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.exchange_token`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token
- Attacker controls: an app configuration that flips the `Context.private?` and `Context.embedded?` guards
- Exploit idea: a subject token can be exchanged repeatedly within its validity window
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
