# Q1980: validate_auth_callback — cookie value becomes the session id via attacker-signed callback

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, makes `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that in the non-embedded branch the returned cookie's value is `session.id`, publishing the storage key to the browser? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app
- Exploit idea: in the non-embedded branch the returned cookie's value is `session.id`, publishing the storage key to the browser
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `begin_auth(shop: 'a.myshopify.com')`, then `validate_auth_callback` with a validly signed query naming shop B, and assert the returned `session.shop`
