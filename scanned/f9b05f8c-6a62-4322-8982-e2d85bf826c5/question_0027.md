# Q27: lib respond the contract returns a

## Question
Can a below-threshold Byzantine participant node acting through an attested responder account enter through `respond` and use the authenticated responder's submitted response object, request body, submission timing, stale local session state, and any replayable MPC artifacts visible before response submission to drive the code path through `crates/contract/src/lib.rs::respond` so that the contract returns a valid signature to the wrong logical request owner, breaking the invariant that callback resolution must stay bound to the original predecessor, path, payload, domain, and request kind, and leading to Unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: crates/contract/src/lib.rs:564::respond
- Entrypoint: `respond`
- Attacker controls: the authenticated responder's submitted response object, request body, submission timing, stale local session state, and any replayable MPC artifacts visible before response submission
- Exploit idea: the contract returns a valid signature to the wrong logical request owner
- Invariant to test: callback resolution must stay bound to the original predecessor, path, payload, domain, and request kind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: submit overlapping requests that share most fields but differ in one authority-bearing field and inspect which callback receives the completion
