# Q1144: collateral-remove via transfer: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `transfer` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
