# Q1797: shopify_header — handler chosen by unsigned data via own-shop signed body

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header` from the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>` with a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers: because `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header`
- Entrypoint: the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`
- Attacker controls: a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers
- Exploit idea: `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
