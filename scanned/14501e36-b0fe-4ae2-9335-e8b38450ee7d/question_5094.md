# Q5094: unified_admin? — nil-safe guard skipped via backslash separator

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` from the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin` with a shop string using a backslash instead of a slash (`https:\\evil.example\admin`), which `Addressable` and HTTParty disagree about: because the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a shop string using a backslash instead of a slash (`https:\\evil.example\admin`), which `Addressable` and HTTParty disagree about
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
