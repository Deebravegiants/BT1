# Q0130: calc-index-next via redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) mint shares whose backing was never received? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
