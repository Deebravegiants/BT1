# Q1075: Amount edge nep141:arb-0xaf88d065e77c8cc feeInclusive: true `amount` = 1n with a large fee (createWithdrawalIntents)

## Question
For `nep141:arb-0xaf88d065e77c8cc2239327c5edb3a432268e5831.omft.near` via PoaBridge with `feeInclusive: true` and `amount` = 1n with a large fee (rounding in `verifyTransferAmount` / minimums), can an unprivileged caller of `IntentsSDK.createWithdrawalIntents` produce intents whose total debit (withdraw amount + `token_diff` amount_in + storage deposit) differs from `withdrawalParams.amount` plus the displayed `feeEstimation.amount`, given that PoaBridge adds `relayerFee` back onto `amount` in `createWithdrawalIntents`; fee is paid in the withdrawn token, so the user is overcharged or the bridge receives an amount it refunds to intents.near instead of the user?

## Target
- File/function: packages/intents-sdk/src/sdk.ts `createWithdrawalIntents` (actualAmount), `_estimateWithdrawalFee` (FeeExceedsAmountError); packages/intents-sdk/src/bridges/poa-bridge/poa-bridge.ts `createWithdrawalIntents`, `validateWithdrawal`
- Entrypoint: `IntentsSDK.createWithdrawalIntents` (returns raw `IntentPrimitive[]` for the integrator to sign with any signer)
- Attacker controls: `amount`, `feeInclusive`, and (for signAndSendWithdrawalIntent) the `feeEstimation` object itself
- Exploit idea: rounding in `verifyTransferAmount` / minimums. `createWithdrawalIntents` subtracts the fee without the `FeeExceedsAmountError` guard that only `_estimateWithdrawalFee` applies. adds `relayerFee` back onto `amount` in `createWithdrawalIntents`; fee is paid in the withdrawn token.
- Invariant to test: sum(debits in produced intents) == amount + (feeInclusive ? 0 : fee) and destination receives amount - (feeInclusive ? fee : 0), both non-negative; else throw before signing.
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - fee overcharge or solver overpaid beyond the displayed fee (HackenProof: fee estimation calculations)
- Fast validation: vitest: call `IntentsSDK.createWithdrawalIntents` with a mocked `FeeEstimation` for PoaBridge, parse the returned intents and sum amounts as BigInt; assert against the formula.
