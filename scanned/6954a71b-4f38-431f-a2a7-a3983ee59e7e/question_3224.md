# Q3224: append_first_party_development_headers — mutable shared header hash via deprecation header

## Question
Can an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, make `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim
- Exploit idea: `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
