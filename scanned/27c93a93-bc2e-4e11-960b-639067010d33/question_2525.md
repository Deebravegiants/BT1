# Q2525: total-supply-preview via accrue: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) — which adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `accrue` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
