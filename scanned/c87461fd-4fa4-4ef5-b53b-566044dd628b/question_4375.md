# Q4375: decode_token — separator collision via sub variants

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#decode_token` through the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')` while supplying a `sub` claim that is absent, non-numeric, negative, zero-padded, or huge, changing `user_id_sub?` and the `#{shop}_#{sub}` key, so that the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: a `sub` claim that is absent, non-numeric, negative, zero-padded, or huge, changing `user_id_sub?` and the `#{shop}_#{sub}` key
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
