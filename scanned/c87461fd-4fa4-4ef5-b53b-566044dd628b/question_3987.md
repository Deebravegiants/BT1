# Q3987: from — temp restores unconditionally via caller-supplied id

## Question
Can the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`, make `Auth::Session.from` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.from`
- Entrypoint: `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`
- Attacker controls: the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key
- Exploit idea: the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
