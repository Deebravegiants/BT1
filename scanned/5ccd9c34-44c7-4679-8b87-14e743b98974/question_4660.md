# Q4660: resolve-or-create via collateral-remove-redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `resolve-or-create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:143` -> `resolve-or-create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `resolve-or-create` allocates a user id through `increment` for whatever principal the market names. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
