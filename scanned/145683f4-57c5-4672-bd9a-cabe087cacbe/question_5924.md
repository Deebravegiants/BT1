# Q5924: interest-rate via collateral-remove-redeem: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `interest-rate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
