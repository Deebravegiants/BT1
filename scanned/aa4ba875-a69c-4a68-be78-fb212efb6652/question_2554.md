# Q2554: request — attacker-steered retry loop via session.shop

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator` at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, makes `Clients::HttpClient#request` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
