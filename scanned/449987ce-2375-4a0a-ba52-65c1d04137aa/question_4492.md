# Q4492: admin_session_token? — type assumptions via Bearer prefix games

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` from `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check with an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix: because `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix
- Exploit idea: `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
