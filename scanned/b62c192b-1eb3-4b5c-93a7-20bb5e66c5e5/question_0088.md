# Q0088: receive-tokens via liquidate: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it pulls an asset from a named account, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `liquidate` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
