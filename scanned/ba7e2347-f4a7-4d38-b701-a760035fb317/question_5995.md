# Q5995: system-repay via liquidate: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
`system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `borrower`, any third-party principal, use that to mint shares whose backing was never received, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `liquidate` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, then read `system-repay` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
