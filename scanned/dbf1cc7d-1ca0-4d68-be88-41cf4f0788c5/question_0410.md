# Q410: begin_auth — redirect target unbound via host parameter

## Question
Can the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, make `Oauth.begin_auth` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself
- Exploit idea: `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
