# Q2987: host_name — thread-local, not request-local via thread-local session

## Question
Trace `Context.host_name` from `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI` with the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread: because `active_session` is thread-local; on a pooled server a session can outlive the request that set it, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.host_name`
- Entrypoint: `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`
- Attacker controls: the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread
- Exploit idea: `active_session` is thread-local; on a pooled server a session can outlive the request that set it
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a crafted `api_version` cannot make `load_rest_resources` touch a path outside `lib/shopify_api/rest/resources`
