# Q4751: admin_session_token? — no iss/dest binding via dest without scheme

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` from `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check with a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip): because the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip)
- Exploit idea: the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
