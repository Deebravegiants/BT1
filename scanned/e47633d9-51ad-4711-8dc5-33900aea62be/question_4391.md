# Q4391: shop — shop never domain-validated via iss suffix

## Question
Does `JwtPayload#shop` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an `iss` that merely ends with `/admin` (for example `https://evil.example/admin`), satisfying `admin_session_token?` at `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`? Show that the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: an `iss` that merely ends with `/admin` (for example `https://evil.example/admin`), satisfying `admin_session_token?`
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
