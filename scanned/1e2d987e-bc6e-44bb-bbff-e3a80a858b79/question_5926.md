# Q5926: calc-index-next via collateral-remove-redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `min-underlying`, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `min-underlying`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
