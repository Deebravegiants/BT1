# Q2936: find-asset via collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the position's existing collateral and debt composition varied, and assert that the value `find-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
