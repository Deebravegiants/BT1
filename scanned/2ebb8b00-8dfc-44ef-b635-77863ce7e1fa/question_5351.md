# Q5351: decode_token — rotation widens acceptance via aud edge

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key) to the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`, does `JwtPayload#decode_token` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key)
- Exploit idea: the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
