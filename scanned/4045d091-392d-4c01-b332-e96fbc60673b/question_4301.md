# Q4301: system-repay via borrow: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) — which splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid` — to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `borrow` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `ft` trait principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
