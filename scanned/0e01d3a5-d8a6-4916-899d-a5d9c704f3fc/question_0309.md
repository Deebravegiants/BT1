# Q0309: convert-to-scaled-debt via liquidate-multi: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `convert-to-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648) — which scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path — to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, breaking the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:648` -> `convert-to-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-scaled-debt` scales a token amount by the cached borrow index, rounding up on the borrow path. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `convert-to-scaled-debt` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
