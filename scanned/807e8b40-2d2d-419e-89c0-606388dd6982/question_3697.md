# Q3697: total-debt via liquidate-redeem: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the borrower targeted, drive `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index` — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `total-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
