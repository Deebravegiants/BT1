# Q3099: mask-pos via borrow: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `borrow` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-pos` touches, run `borrow` with the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
