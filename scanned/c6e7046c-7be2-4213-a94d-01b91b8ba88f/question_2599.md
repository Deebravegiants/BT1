# Q2599: debt-preview via liquidate-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, then read `debt-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
