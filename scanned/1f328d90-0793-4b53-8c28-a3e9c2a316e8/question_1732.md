# Q1732: validate — authenticity is not authorisation via length-varied digest

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling to `ShopifyAPI::Utils::HmacValidator.validate`, the single arbiter of authenticity for both the OAuth callback and every inbound webhook, does `HmacValidator.validate` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because a valid signature proves Shopify signed something for some shop, not that it was for this shop, this browser or this topic? Close the question on SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/hmac_validator.rb` -> `HmacValidator.validate`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::HmacValidator.validate`, the single arbiter of authenticity for both the OAuth callback and every inbound webhook
- Attacker controls: a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling
- Exploit idea: a valid signature proves Shopify signed something for some shop, not that it was for this shop, this browser or this topic
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `validate` returns false for an empty-string hmac and for a wrong-length digest
