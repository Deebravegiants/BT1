# Q0099: vault-accrue via liquidate-multi: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
`vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, use that to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, violating the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `vault-accrue` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
