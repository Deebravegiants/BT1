# Q0570: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling call ordering within the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) mint shares whose backing was never received? `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz call ordering within the block across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
