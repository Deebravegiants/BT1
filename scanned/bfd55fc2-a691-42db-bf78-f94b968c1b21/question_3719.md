# Q3719: check-confidence via borrow: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`check-confidence` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305) compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:305` -> `check-confidence`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `check-confidence` compares the Pyth confidence interval against `max-confidence-ratio` in BPS, a gate that has no DIA equivalent. Reach it through `borrow` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
