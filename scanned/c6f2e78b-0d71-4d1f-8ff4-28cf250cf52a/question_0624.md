# Q0624: subset via repay: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it tests bitmask containment, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `repay` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list across its boundary values through `repay` in simnet and assert `subset` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
