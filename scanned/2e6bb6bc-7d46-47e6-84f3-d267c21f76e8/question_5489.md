# Q5489: status via collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, drive `status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115) — which derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed — to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause permanent freezing of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115` -> `status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
