# Q5718: get-asset-value via liquidate-multi: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz which borrowers are placed early versus late in the batch across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `get-asset-value` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
