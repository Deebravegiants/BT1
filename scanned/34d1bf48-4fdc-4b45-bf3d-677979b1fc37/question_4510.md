# Q4510: status via collateral-add: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `status` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:115` -> `status`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `status` derives `collateral` and `debt` flags from bit tests against whatever mask it was handed. Reach it through `collateral-add` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
