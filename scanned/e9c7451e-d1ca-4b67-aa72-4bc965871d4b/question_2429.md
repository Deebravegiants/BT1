# Q2429: initialize — asymmetric comparison via scope string from a token response

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Auth::AuthScopes#initialize` through `AuthScopes.new(scope_names)`, which splits a string on `,` with no token validation while supplying the `scope` / `associated_user_scope` strings returned with an access token and stored on the session, so that `covers?` compares the other side's compressed set against this side's expanded set, so the relation is not symmetric, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `AuthScopes.new(scope_names)`, which splits a string on `,` with no token validation
- Attacker controls: the `scope` / `associated_user_scope` strings returned with an access token and stored on the session
- Exploit idea: `covers?` compares the other side's compressed set against this side's expanded set, so the relation is not symmetric
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `==` distinguishes two scope sets whose expanded permissions differ
