# Q3788: collateral-remove via collateral-remove: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `price-feeds` buffers varied, and assert that the value `collateral-remove` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
