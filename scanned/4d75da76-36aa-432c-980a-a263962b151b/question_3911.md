# Q3911: shopify_user_id — rotation widens acceptance via dest with embedded separator

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` from `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?` with a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator: because the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator
- Exploit idea: the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
