# Q1158: exchange_token — session keyed by claim via replayed subject token

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the same `subject_token` submitted repeatedly, since nothing tracks consumption to `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token, does `TokenExchange.exchange_token` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `Session.from(shop: dest_shop, ...)` mints the storage key from the same unvalidated claim? Close the question on SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and on Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.exchange_token`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token
- Attacker controls: the same `subject_token` submitted repeatedly, since nothing tracks consumption
- Exploit idea: `Session.from(shop: dest_shop, ...)` mints the storage key from the same unvalidated claim
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: mint a token whose `dest` is a non-Shopify host, call `exchange_token`, and assert no request carrying `client_secret` left for that host
