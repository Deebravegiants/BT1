# Q0584: receive-tokens via collateral-remove-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) reach `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it pulls an asset from a named account, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch)
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with the zToken/underlying id mapping reached (the u100 sentinel branch) varied, and assert that the value `receive-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
