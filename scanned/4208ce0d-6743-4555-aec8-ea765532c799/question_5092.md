# Q5092: serialized_error — host header split from connection host via shop.dev host

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite to `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers, does `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite
- Exploit idea: when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
