# Q1866: find-collateral-amount via supply-collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), can an unprivileged attacker make `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `find-collateral-amount` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
