# Q1186: Public-call brick via stake under victim pair same epoch full position edge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker compose valid public calls around `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake()` with one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked and all attacker-visible steps happen in the same epoch before any natural reward settlement, so the pool reaches a state where `internal_ping()` or a later public method reliably panics on invariant checks and honest users can no longer settle rewards, unstake, or withdraw?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_stake` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping`, `last_total_balance`, `total_staked_balance`, and assertion-based state transitions
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake()`
- Attacker controls: stake amount, pre-existing unstaked balance, number of attacker accounts, and call ordering around epoch changes; one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked; all attacker-visible steps happen in the same epoch before any natural reward settlement; near-full-position amounts that leave, consume, or depend on a one-yocto residual balance/share edge
- Exploit idea: Look for a sequence where user-triggered accounting deltas make a later assertion on `last_total_balance`, total shares, or total stake unsatisfiable without privileged repair.
- Invariant to test: Any state reachable solely through valid public methods must remain serviceable by later valid public methods and must not permanently freeze user funds.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Contracts execution flows
- Fast validation: Stateful fuzzing over all public user calls with `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake()` emphasized; stop on any sequence that causes all future `ping()/unstake()/withdraw()` attempts to panic.
