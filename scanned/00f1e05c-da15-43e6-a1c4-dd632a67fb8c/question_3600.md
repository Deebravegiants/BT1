# Q3600: zip via collateral-remove-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver` for the underlying leg reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver` for the underlying leg across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
