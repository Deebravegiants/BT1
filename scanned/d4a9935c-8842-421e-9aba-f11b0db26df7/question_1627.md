# Q1627: accrue via collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing `amount`, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835` -> `accrue`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue` advances `last-update` only inside `(if (or (not (is-eq idx next)) ...))`, so an interval whose multiplier rounds to INDEX-PRECISION leaves the clock stale. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `accrue` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
