# Q4467: initialize — copy preserves the key via online/offline flip

## Question
Starting from `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable, can an unprivileged attacker supply an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?` so that `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `Auth::Session#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable
- Attacker controls: an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?`
- Exploit idea: `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
