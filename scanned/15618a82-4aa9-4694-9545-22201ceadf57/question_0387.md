# Q387: initialize — no freshness via encoding-sensitive values

## Question
Does `AuthQuery#initialize` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits values whose `URI.encode_www_form` serialisation differs from the raw query string Shopify signed (spaces vs `+`, `%20`, unreserved-char casing) at `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string? Show that nothing bounds the age of a signed callback, so a captured one stays valid indefinitely, that SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string
- Attacker controls: values whose `URI.encode_www_form` serialisation differs from the raw query string Shopify signed (spaces vs `+`, `%20`, unreserved-char casing)
- Exploit idea: nothing bounds the age of a signed callback, so a captured one stays valid indefinitely
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: build the query two ways, assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both, and diff the two `to_signable_string` outputs
