# Q5143: get_path — read-only filter applied late via read-only attribute

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.get_path` from `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids with an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update`: because the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids
- Attacker controls: an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update`
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
