# Q2690: temp — nil means valid via copy across identities

## Question
Does `Auth::Session.temp` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id` at `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block? Show that `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.temp`
- Entrypoint: `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block
- Attacker controls: a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`
- Exploit idea: `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
