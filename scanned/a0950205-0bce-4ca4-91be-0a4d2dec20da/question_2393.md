# Q2393: validate_auth_callback — HMAC precedes but does not bind via cross-shop state reuse

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `state` nonce obtained from the attacker's own `begin_auth` call and presented with a callback naming a different `shop` at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, makes `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: a `state` nonce obtained from the attacker's own `begin_auth` call and presented with a callback naming a different `shop`
- Exploit idea: `HmacValidator.validate(auth_query)` proves Shopify signed those five fields, not that this browser began this authorization
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
