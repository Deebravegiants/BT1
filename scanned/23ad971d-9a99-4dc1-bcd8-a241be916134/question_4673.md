# Q4673: set_property — dynamic dispatch on response data via ids hash

## Question
Can the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, make `Rest::Base#set_property` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
