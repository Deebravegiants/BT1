# Q2095: callback_address — unanchored host match via host_name prefix match

## Question
Does `Registrations::Http#callback_address` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a path whose prefix merely matches `Context.host_name` under an unanchored `%r{^#{Context.host_name}}` test, e.g. `example.com.evil.example/hook` at `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`? Show that the `^#{Context.host_name}` test is a prefix match on an unescaped interpolation, so a look-alike host passes, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: a path whose prefix merely matches `Context.host_name` under an unanchored `%r{^#{Context.host_name}}` test, e.g. `example.com.evil.example/hook`
- Exploit idea: the `^#{Context.host_name}` test is a prefix match on an unescaped interpolation, so a look-alike host passes
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `callback_address` never returns a host outside the app's own origin
