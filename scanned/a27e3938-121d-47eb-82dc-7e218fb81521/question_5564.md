# Q5564: append_first_party_development_headers — dev-mode rewrite in production via scheme in path

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL at `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, makes `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
