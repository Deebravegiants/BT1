# Q0774: debt-add-scaled via collateral-remove: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the set of assets held, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) mint shares whose backing was never received? `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the set of assets held across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `debt-add-scaled` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
