# Q4774: trusted_domains — trusted list widened per call via whitespace and control bytes

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` through `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only while supplying a shop string padded with control bytes, newlines or tabs that `strip` does not remove but a header serialiser does, so that `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a shop string padded with control bytes, newlines or tabs that `strip` does not remove but a header serialiser does
- Exploit idea: `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
