# Q5462: total-supply-preview via accrue: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) while controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `accrue` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `accrue` twice with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block varied, and assert that the value `total-supply-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
