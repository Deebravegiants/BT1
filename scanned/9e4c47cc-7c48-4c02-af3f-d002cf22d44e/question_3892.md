# Q3892: current_session_id — no shop cross-check via shop with underscore

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.current_session_id` through `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves while supplying a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key, so that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.current_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves
- Attacker controls: a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
