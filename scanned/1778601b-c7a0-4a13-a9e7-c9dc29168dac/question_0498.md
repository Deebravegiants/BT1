# Q0498: factory deployment: exploit appendBytecodeChunk/resetBytecod [when a same-token second leg i]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit appendBytecodeChunk/resetBytecodeChunks ordering so deployHinkal deploys mismatched bytecode passing the hash, to hijack the deterministic Hinkal address, deploy attacker bytecode at it, or permanently block the intended deployment, specifically when a same-token second leg is present in the same call (where the per-token loop processes that token twice)?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/HinkalFactory.sol :: deployHinkal / appendBytecodeChunk / HinkalFactoryDeployer
- Entrypoint: HinkalFactoryDeployer constructor / HinkalFactory (pre-ownership)
- Attacker controls: create2 salt via SAFE_SINGLETON_FACTORY, deployment ordering (only if reachable pre-owner)
- Exploit idea: race or corrupt the deterministic deployment before ownership is settled
- Invariant to test: the code at the deterministic Hinkal address == the audited Hinkal bytecode
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: permanent freezing of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry: simulate the create2 race/hash mismatch, assert wrong code or blocked deploy
