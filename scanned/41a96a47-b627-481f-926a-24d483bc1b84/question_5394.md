# Q5394: sanitize! — validator returns a non-Shopify host via trailing-dot host

## Question
Can a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`, make `ShopValidator.sanitize!` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Entrypoint: `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
