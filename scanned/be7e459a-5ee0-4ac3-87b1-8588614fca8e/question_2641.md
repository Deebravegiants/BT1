# Q2641: get-account-scaled-debt via repay: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `get-account-scaled-debt` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307) — which reads one scaled debt row — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:307` -> `get-account-scaled-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-account-scaled-debt` reads one scaled debt row. Reach it through `repay` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `get-account-scaled-debt` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
