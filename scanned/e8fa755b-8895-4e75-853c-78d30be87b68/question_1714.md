# Q1714: validate_auth_callback — no replay window via expired cookie

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `SessionCookie` presented after its 60-second `expires` has passed, which the gem never re-checks on the callback side at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, makes `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: a `SessionCookie` presented after its 60-second `expires` has passed, which the gem never re-checks on the callback side
- Exploit idea: nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
