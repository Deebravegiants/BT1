# Q4071: request_url — header override ordering via session.shop

## Question
Can `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, make `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
