# Q2964: normalize-pyth via collateral-remove: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `normalize-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:297` -> `normalize-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `normalize-pyth` computes `adj` as `(+ expo 8)`, uses an `asserts!` as an early return when `adj` is zero, and converts a signed `int` price with `to-uint`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `normalize-pyth` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
