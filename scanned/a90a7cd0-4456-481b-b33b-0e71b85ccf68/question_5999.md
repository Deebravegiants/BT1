# Q5999: to_signable_string — verified bytes != parsed bytes via base64url vs standard

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string` through `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else while supplying a base64url-encoded digest (`-`/`_`) that `decode64` reinterprets, so that `@raw_body` at verification time and the string `JSON.parse` consumes are not guaranteed identical, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else
- Attacker controls: a base64url-encoded digest (`-`/`_`) that `decode64` reinterprets
- Exploit idea: `@raw_body` at verification time and the string `JSON.parse` consumes are not guaranteed identical
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
