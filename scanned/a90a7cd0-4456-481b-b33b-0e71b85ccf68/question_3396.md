# Q3396: begin_auth — cookie carries no shop via host parameter

## Question
Starting from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, can an unprivileged attacker supply the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself so that `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Oauth.begin_auth`, and whether the result reaches High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: the base64 `host` parameter, which is signed but never validated as a Shopify admin host before the app uses it to frame itself
- Exploit idea: `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `begin_auth(shop: 'a.myshopify.com')`, then `validate_auth_callback` with a validly signed query naming shop B, and assert the returned `session.shop`
