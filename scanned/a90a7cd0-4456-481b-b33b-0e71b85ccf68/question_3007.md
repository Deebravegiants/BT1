# Q3007: get_webhook_id — verification result not carried via registry mutation timing

## Question
Can concurrent `add_registration`/`clear` against `process`, since `@registry` is a plain class-level hash, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `get_webhook_id(topic:, client:)`, which interpolates `topic.gsub(%r{/|\.}, "_").upcase` into a GraphQL document, make `Webhooks::Registry.get_webhook_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `process` proves the body was signed, then passes headers the signature never covered into the handler? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.get_webhook_id`
- Entrypoint: `get_webhook_id(topic:, client:)`, which interpolates `topic.gsub(%r{/|\.}, "_").upcase` into a GraphQL document
- Attacker controls: concurrent `add_registration`/`clear` against `process`, since `@registry` is a plain class-level hash
- Exploit idea: `process` proves the body was signed, then passes headers the signature never covered into the handler
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay one signed delivery twice and assert the handler is invoked at most once per `webhook-id`
