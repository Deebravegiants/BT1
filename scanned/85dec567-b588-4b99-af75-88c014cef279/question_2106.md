# Q2106: request_url — dev-mode rewrite in production via query/fragment injection

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query at the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, makes `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
