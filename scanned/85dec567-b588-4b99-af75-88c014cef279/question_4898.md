# Q4898: method_missing — cursor trusted via ids hash

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base#method_missing` from `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access with the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path: because page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
