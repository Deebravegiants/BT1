# Q3762: get_check_aligned settles one authorization twice (invoke_context.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `get_check_aligned` in `program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs` with a payload that satisfies the cheap precondition but not the full check, and have `get_check_aligned` apply the same authorized effect a second time, so that the invariant "One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `program-runtime/src/invoke_context.rs` -> `get_check_aligned()` (around line 800)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: a payload that satisfies the cheap precondition but not the full check
- Exploit idea: Get `get_check_aligned` to apply the same logical effect twice from a single user authorization by re-entering it or replaying the surrounding flow.
- Invariant to test: One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Integration test: submit the flow twice (and once re-entrantly) and assert the second application is rejected and balances moved once.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can replay or double-apply one signed transaction through durable-nonce advance, blockhash-queue aging, or status-cache dedup so a single authorization settles more than once.
