# Q5865: total-assets-preview via accrue: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, drive `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) — which re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued — to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `accrue` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets-preview` touches, run `accrue` with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
