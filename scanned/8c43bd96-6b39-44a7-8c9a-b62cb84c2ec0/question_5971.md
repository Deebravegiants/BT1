# Q5971: find-asset via supply-collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
`find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), use that to mint shares whose backing was never received, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `find-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
