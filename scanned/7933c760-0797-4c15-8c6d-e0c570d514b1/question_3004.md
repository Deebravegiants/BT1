# Q3004: append_first_party_development_headers — response content into logs via query/fragment injection

## Question
Starting from `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query so that response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`, and whether the result reaches Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
