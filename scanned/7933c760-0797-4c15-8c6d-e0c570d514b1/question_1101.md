# Q1101: shop — header collision via duplicate header prefixes

## Question
Does `Webhooks::Request#shop` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits both `shopify-topic` and `x-shopify-topic` set to different values, exploiting the `||` preference order at `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header? Show that two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup, that BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shop`
- Entrypoint: `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header
- Attacker controls: both `shopify-topic` and `x-shopify-topic` set to different values, exploiting the `||` preference order
- Exploit idea: two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
