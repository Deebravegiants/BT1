# Q3395: sanitize_shop_domain — differential between the two entry points via suffix-confusion host

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` through a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` while supplying a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`, so that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
