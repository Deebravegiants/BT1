# Q1241: sanitize_shop_domain — nil-safe guard skipped via IDN / Unicode label

## Question
Does `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip` at a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`? Show that the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict, that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip`
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
