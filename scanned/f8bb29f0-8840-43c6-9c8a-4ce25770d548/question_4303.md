# Q4303: shopify_user_id — unanchored substitution via dest without scheme

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` from `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?` with a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip): because `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip)
- Exploit idea: `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
