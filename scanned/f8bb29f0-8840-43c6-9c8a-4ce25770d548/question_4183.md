# Q4183: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — validator returns a non-Shopify host via suffix-confusion host

## Question
Can a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment, make `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
