# Q1984: shopify_user_id — leeway on both ends via dest with embedded separator

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator to `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, does `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator
- Exploit idea: a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
