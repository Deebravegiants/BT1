```rust
//! A pallet which uses the XCMP transport layer to handle both incoming and outgoing XCM message
//! sending and dispatch, queuing, signalling and backpressure. To do so, it implements:
//! * `XcmpMessageHandler`
//! * `XcmpMessageSource`
//!
//! Also provides an implementation of `SendXcm` which can be placed in a router tuple for relaying
//! XCM over XCMP if the destination is `Parent/Parachain`. It requires an implementation of
//! `XcmExecutor` for dispatching incoming XCM messages.
//!
//! To prevent out of memory errors on the `OutboundXcmpMessages` queue, an exponential fee factor
//! (`DeliveryFeeFactor`) is set, much like the one used in DMP.
//! The fee factor increases whenever the total size of messages in a particular channel passes a
//! threshold. This threshold is defined as a percentage of the maximum total size the channel can
//! have. More concretely, the threshold is `max_total_size` / `THRESHOLD_FACTOR`, where:
//! - `max_total_size` is the maximum size, in bytes, of the channel, not number of messages.
//! It is defined in the channel configuration.
//! - `THRESHOLD_FACTOR` just declares which percentage of the max size is the actual threshold.
//! If it's 2, then the threshold is half of the max size, if it's 4, it's a quarter, and so on.
