# Q4491: parsed_body — header collision via base64 padding variants

## Question
Can an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification, make `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body`
- Entrypoint: `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification
- Attacker controls: an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops
- Exploit idea: two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
