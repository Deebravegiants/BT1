# Q3558: == — id and shop can disagree via nil expires

## Question
Does `Auth::Session#==` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an access-token response with no `expires_in`, leaving `@expires` nil and `expired?` permanently false at `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches? Show that `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#==`
- Entrypoint: `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches
- Attacker controls: an access-token response with no `expires_in`, leaving `@expires` nil and `expired?` permanently false
- Exploit idea: `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
