# Q2434: get_connection_stake is not deterministic across nodes (quic.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `get_connection_stake` in `streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and make the priority used to order a transaction disagree with the fee the transaction actually pays, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `get_connection_stake` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/nonblocking/quic.rs` -> `get_connection_stake()` (around line 416)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Find input to `get_connection_stake` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `get_connection_stake` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `get_connection_stake` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can submit a transaction whose loading, sanitization, ALT resolution, or execution result differs between honest validators, causing bank-hash divergence, a fork, or an unbootable ledger replay.
