# Q2508: debt-preview via accrue: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the utilization the rate is interpolated at reach `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index, the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `accrue` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the utilization the rate is interpolated at across its boundary values through `accrue` in simnet and assert `debt-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
