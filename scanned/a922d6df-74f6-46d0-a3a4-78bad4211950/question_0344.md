# Q344: post — caller headers win via path prefix admin/

## Question
Starting from `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely so that `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Clients::Rest::Admin#post`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#post`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token
- Attacker controls: a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a user-supplied resource id containing `/`, `?` or `#` cannot change the recorded request path beyond one segment
