# Q0576: mask-to-list-collateral via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let reach `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
