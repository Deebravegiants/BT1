# Q4640: initialize — token attached before destination is settled via session.shop

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator` at `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, makes `Clients::HttpClient#initialize` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`
- Attacker controls: `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
