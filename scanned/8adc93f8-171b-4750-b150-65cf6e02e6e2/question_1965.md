# Q1965: validate_auth_callback — error path leaks via chosen state cookie

## Question
Trace `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route with the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely: because `Errors::RequestAccessTokenError` and the HTTParty failure path surface response contents built from a request that carried `client_secret`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely
- Exploit idea: `Errors::RequestAccessTokenError` and the HTTParty failure path surface response contents built from a request that carried `client_secret`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
