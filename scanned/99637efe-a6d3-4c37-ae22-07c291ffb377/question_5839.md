# Q5839: get-position via supply-collateral-add: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, then read `get-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
