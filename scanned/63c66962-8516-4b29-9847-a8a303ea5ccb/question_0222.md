# Q222: add_registration — tenant identity handed over unverified via registry mutation timing

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Registry.add_registration` from `add_registration(topic:, delivery_method:, path:, handler:, fields:, filter:, metafield_namespaces:)` with concurrent `add_registration`/`clear` against `process`, since `@registry` is a plain class-level hash: because `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value the host app uses to choose whose records to touch, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.add_registration`
- Entrypoint: `add_registration(topic:, delivery_method:, path:, handler:, fields:, filter:, metafield_namespaces:)`
- Attacker controls: concurrent `add_registration`/`clear` against `process`, since `@registry` is a plain class-level hash
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value the host app uses to choose whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a topic containing GraphQL metacharacters cannot alter the document sent by `get_webhook_id`
