# Q4779: resolve-callcode via collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
`resolve-callcode` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349) chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:349` -> `resolve-callcode`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-callcode` chains callcode transforms, with CALLCODE-ZSTSTX composing `resolve-ztoken` over `resolve-ststx`. Reach it through `collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-callcode` touches, run `collateral-add` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
