# Q1455: is-healthy-with-mask via borrow: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `borrow` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `is-healthy-with-mask` touches, run `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
