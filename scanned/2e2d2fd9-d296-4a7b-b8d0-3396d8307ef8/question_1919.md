# Q1919: linear-interpolate via call-ststx-ratio: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Can an unprivileged caller of `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), by choosing whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `call-ststx-ratio` call, then the attacker-shaped one with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
