# Q1032: covers? — parsing is lossy via delimiter in a scope name

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a scope name containing `,` so one entry becomes two to `AuthScopes#covers?(auth_scopes)`, which apps call to decide whether a session may perform an operation, does `Auth::AuthScopes#covers?` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because splitting and stripping can merge or drop entries so the parsed set differs from the granted grant? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#covers?`
- Entrypoint: `AuthScopes#covers?(auth_scopes)`, which apps call to decide whether a session may perform an operation
- Attacker controls: a scope name containing `,` so one entry becomes two
- Exploit idea: splitting and stripping can merge or drop entries so the parsed set differs from the granted grant
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: assert `covers?` is false for any scope name outside a known Shopify scope vocabulary
