# Q1376: setup — version becomes a path via expiring_offline_access_tokens

## Question
Can the `expiring_offline_access_tokens` flag, which changes token lifetime and the `expiring` body field, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`, make `Context.setup` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.setup`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`
- Attacker controls: the `expiring_offline_access_tokens` flag, which changes token lifetime and the `expiring` body field
- Exploit idea: `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a crafted `api_version` cannot make `load_rest_resources` touch a path outside `lib/shopify_api/rest/resources`
