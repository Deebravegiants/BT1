# Q3273: setup — setup? is a presence check via thread-local session

## Question
Can the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`, make `Context.setup` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.setup`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`
- Attacker controls: the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread
- Exploit idea: `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: run two threads through `Session.temp` and assert neither observes the other's active session
