# Q5783: hmac — no replay protection via base64 padding variants

## Question
Starting from `Request#hmac`, which returns `Digest.hexencode(Base64.decode64(header))` for the `x-shopify-hmac-sha256` header, can an unprivileged attacker supply an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops so that no nonce, timestamp or delivery-id tracking bounds re-delivery of a signed body? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `Webhooks::Request#hmac`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#hmac`
- Entrypoint: `Request#hmac`, which returns `Digest.hexencode(Base64.decode64(header))` for the `x-shopify-hmac-sha256` header
- Attacker controls: an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops
- Exploit idea: no nonce, timestamp or delivery-id tracking bounds re-delivery of a signed body
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
