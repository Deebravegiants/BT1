# Q2623: shopify_header — verified bytes != parsed bytes via body byte variance

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header` from the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>` with a raw body whose bytes differ from what the framework hands to `JSON.parse` (encoding conversion, BOM, trailing newline, rewound stream): because `@raw_body` at verification time and the string `JSON.parse` consumes are not guaranteed identical, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header`
- Entrypoint: the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`
- Attacker controls: a raw body whose bytes differ from what the framework hands to `JSON.parse` (encoding conversion, BOM, trailing newline, rewound stream)
- Exploit idea: `@raw_body` at verification time and the string `JSON.parse` consumes are not guaranteed identical
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
