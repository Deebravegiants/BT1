# Q726: auth_base_uri — redirect target unbound via chosen state cookie

## Question
Trace `Oauth.auth_base_uri` from the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator` with the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely: because `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely
- Exploit idea: `redirect_uri` is built from `Context.host` + `redirect_path` at authorize time but never re-verified at callback time
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
