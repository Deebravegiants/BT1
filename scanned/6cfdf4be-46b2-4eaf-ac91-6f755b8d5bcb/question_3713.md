# Q3713: append_first_party_development_headers — header override ordering via request.path

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping to `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, does `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
