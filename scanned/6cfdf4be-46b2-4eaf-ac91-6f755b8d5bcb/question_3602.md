# Q3602: refresh_token_expired? — nil means valid via caller-supplied id

## Question
Can the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil, make `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?`
- Entrypoint: `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key
- Exploit idea: `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
