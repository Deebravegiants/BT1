# Q5914: find-superset via liquidate: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `liquidate` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
