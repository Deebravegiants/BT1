# Q1258: calc-final-liquidation-amounts via liquidate: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:834` -> `calc-final-liquidation-amounts`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-final-liquidation-amounts` recomputes debt proportionally when collateral was capped, a SECOND re-derivation after `process-debt-asset` already capped once. Reach it through `liquidate` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
