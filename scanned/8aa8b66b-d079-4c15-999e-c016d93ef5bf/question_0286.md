# Q0286: calc-multiplier-delta via call-ststx-ratio: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) mint shares whose backing was never received? `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
