# Q5352: request_url — token attached before destination is settled via request.path

## Question
Can the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, make `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping
- Exploit idea: `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
