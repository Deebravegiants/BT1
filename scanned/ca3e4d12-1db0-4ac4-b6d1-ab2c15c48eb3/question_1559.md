# Q1559: jwt_session_id — interpolation collision via non-embedded config

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` from `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation with an app configured `is_embedded: false`, where the cookie is the only accepted credential: because string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: an app configured `is_embedded: false`, where the cookie is the only accepted credential
- Exploit idea: string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
