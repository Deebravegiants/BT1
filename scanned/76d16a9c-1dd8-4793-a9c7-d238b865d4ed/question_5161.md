# Q5161: decode_token — unanchored substitution via sid claim

## Question
Does `JwtPayload#decode_token` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity at the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`? Show that `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme, that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity
- Exploit idea: `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
