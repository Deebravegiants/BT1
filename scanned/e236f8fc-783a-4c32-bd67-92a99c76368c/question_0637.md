# Q637: trusted_domains — validated value discarded via suffix-confusion host

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` through `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only while supplying a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`, so that the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`
- Exploit idea: the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
