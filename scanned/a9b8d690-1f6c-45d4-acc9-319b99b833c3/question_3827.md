# Q3827: copy_attributes_from — temp restores unconditionally via caller-supplied id

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from` from `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id` with the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key: because the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from`
- Entrypoint: `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id`
- Attacker controls: the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key
- Exploit idea: the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
