# Q4331: expired? — id and shop can disagree via nil expires

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session#expired?` from `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil with an access-token response with no `expires_in`, leaving `@expires` nil and `expired?` permanently false: because `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#expired?`
- Entrypoint: `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: an access-token response with no `expires_in`, leaving `@expires` nil and `expired?` permanently false
- Exploit idea: `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
