# Q3332: unpack-u16 via supply-collateral-add: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position state the final collateral-add is validated against reach `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position state the final collateral-add is validated against
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with the position state the final collateral-add is validated against varied, and assert that the value `unpack-u16` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
