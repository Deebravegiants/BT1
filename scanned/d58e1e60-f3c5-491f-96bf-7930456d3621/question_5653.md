# Q5653: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — parse/resolve divergence via caller-supplied myshopify_domain

## Question
Can a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment, make `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call
- Exploit idea: what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
