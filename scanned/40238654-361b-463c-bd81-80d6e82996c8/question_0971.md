# Q971: == — identity built by interpolation via associated_user id

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session#==` from `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches with the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id: because session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#==`
- Entrypoint: `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches
- Attacker controls: the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id
- Exploit idea: session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
