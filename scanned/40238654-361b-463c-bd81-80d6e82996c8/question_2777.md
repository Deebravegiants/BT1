# Q2777: unified_admin? — path segment trusted as identity via empty path segment

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` from the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin` with a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant: because the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant
- Exploit idea: the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
