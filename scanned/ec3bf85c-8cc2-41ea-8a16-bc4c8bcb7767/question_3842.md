# Q3842: jwt_session_id — caller decides identity shape via guessed offline key

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint at `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation, makes `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
