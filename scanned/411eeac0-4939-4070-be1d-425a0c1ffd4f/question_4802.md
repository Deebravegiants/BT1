# Q4802: request — string interpolation, not URL joining via api_host config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#request` through `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request while supplying an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere, so that the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere
- Exploit idea: the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
