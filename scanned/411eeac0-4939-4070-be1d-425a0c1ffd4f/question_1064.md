# Q1064: migrate_to_expiring_token — client_secret sent to a derived host via dest-controlled host

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` through `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)` while supplying the `dest` claim, which becomes `dest_shop` and then `Session.new(shop: dest_shop)` and then the request host, with no `ShopValidator` call, so that the POST body carries `client_id` and `client_secret` to `https://#{dest_shop}/admin/oauth/access_token`, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Entrypoint: `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`
- Attacker controls: the `dest` claim, which becomes `dest_shop` and then `Session.new(shop: dest_shop)` and then the request host, with no `ShopValidator` call
- Exploit idea: the POST body carries `client_id` and `client_secret` to `https://#{dest_shop}/admin/oauth/access_token`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
