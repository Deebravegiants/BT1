# Q3161: get_webhook_id — no replay tracking via unsigned topic header

## Question
Can the topic, taken from an unsigned header, used both to select the handler and to build GraphQL documents, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `get_webhook_id(topic:, client:)`, which interpolates `topic.gsub(%r{/|\.}, "_").upcase` into a GraphQL document, make `Webhooks::Registry.get_webhook_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that no delivery-id or timestamp bookkeeping bounds re-delivery? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.get_webhook_id`
- Entrypoint: `get_webhook_id(topic:, client:)`, which interpolates `topic.gsub(%r{/|\.}, "_").upcase` into a GraphQL document
- Attacker controls: the topic, taken from an unsigned header, used both to select the handler and to build GraphQL documents
- Exploit idea: no delivery-id or timestamp bookkeeping bounds re-delivery
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `WebhookMetadata#shop` cannot differ from a shop authenticated by the request
