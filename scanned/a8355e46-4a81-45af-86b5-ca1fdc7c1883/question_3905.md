# Q3905: method_missing — cursor trusted via pagination cursors

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request at `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access, makes `Rest::Base#method_missing` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
