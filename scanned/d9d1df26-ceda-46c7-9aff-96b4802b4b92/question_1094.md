# Q1094: linear-interpolate via collateral-remove-redeem: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, so the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem varied, and assert that the value `linear-interpolate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
