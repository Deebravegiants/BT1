# Q5480: request — response content into logs via absolute path

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `path` beginning with `/` or `//host`, which changes the authority the interpolated URL resolves to at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, makes `Clients::HttpClient#request` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a `path` beginning with `/` or `//host`, which changes the authority the interpolated URL resolves to
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
