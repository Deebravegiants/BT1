# Q2161: oracle-last-update via liquidate-redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, drive `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) — which returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, then read `oracle-last-update` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
