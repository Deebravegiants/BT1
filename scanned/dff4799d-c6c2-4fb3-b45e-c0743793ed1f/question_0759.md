# Q759: bio auth.ios lifecycle state bleed via BioAuth

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use mobile unlock or approval flow that invokes PIN/biometric authentication with attacker-controlled `port`, `port`, and transition timing so that `BioAuth` in `features/auth-mobile/module/bio/bio-auth.ios.js` cause lifecycle hooks or event emission to run before security-critical state is committed or validated, violating the rule that imported or restored state must bind only to the intended active seed and wallet account, and ultimately reaching `Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/auth-mobile/module/bio/bio-auth.ios.js::BioAuth
- Entrypoint: mobile unlock or approval flow that invokes PIN/biometric authentication
- Attacker controls: an imported backup or mnemonic payload, the passphrase field, and call ordering across create/import/unlock
- Exploit idea: cause lifecycle hooks or event emission to run before security-critical state is committed or validated
- Invariant to test: imported or restored state must bind only to the intended active seed and wallet account
- Expected Immunefi impact: Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds
- Fast validation: restore crafted state across multiple wallet accounts and assert only the intended seed/account pair is mutated or exposed
