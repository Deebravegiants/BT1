# Q2730: validate_auth_callback — private-app guard ordering via unsanitised shop param

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` through `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route while supplying the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, so that `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Exploit idea: `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
