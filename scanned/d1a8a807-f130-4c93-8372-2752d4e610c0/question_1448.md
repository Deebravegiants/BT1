# Q1448: migrate_to_expiring_token — error branch reveals verdict via requested token type

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `requested_token_type:` argument, selecting an online or offline token for the same subject token at `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`, makes `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Entrypoint: `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`
- Attacker controls: the `requested_token_type:` argument, selecting an online or offline token for the same subject token
- Exploit idea: distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
