# Q3783: request — host header split from connection host via base_path argument

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `base_path:` argument, concatenated into `@base_uri_and_path` with no separator normalisation to `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, does `Clients::HttpClient#request` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: the `base_path:` argument, concatenated into `@base_uri_and_path` with no separator normalisation
- Exploit idea: when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
