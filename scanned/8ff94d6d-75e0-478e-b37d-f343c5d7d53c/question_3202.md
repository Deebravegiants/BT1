# Q3202: send-tokens via transfer: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `transfer` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with the destination principal, including the market, the market-vault or the treasury, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
