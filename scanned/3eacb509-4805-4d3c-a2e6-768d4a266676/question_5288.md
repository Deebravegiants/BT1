# Q5288: method_missing — method shadowing via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name to `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access, does `Rest::Base#method_missing` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
