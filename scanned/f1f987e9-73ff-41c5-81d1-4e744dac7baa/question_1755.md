# Q1755: get_path_ids — dynamic dispatch on response data via ids hash

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.get_path_ids` from `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires with the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path: because `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path_ids`
- Entrypoint: `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires
- Attacker controls: the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
