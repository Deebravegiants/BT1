# Q1241: mask-to-list-collateral via collateral-remove: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the set of assets held, drive `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) — which expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64 — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the set of assets held, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
