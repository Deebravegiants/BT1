# Q1411: convert-to-assets-preview via deposit: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `min-out`, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `deposit` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `deposit` with `min-out`, then read `convert-to-assets-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
