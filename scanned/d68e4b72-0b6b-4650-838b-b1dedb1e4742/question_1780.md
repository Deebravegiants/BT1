# Q1780: filter-out-debt-asset via collateral-remove-redeem: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `filter-out-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:633` -> `filter-out-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `filter-out-debt-asset` rebuilds the debt list without one asset, under `as-max-len? ... u64`. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove-redeem` with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
