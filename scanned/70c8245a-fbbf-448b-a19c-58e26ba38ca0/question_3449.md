# Q3449: find-collateral-amount via collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling `amount`, drive `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) — which returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
