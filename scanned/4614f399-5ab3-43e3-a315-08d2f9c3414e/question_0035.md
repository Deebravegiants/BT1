# Q35: initialize — string interpolation, not URL joining via empty access token

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#initialize` through `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token` while supplying a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response, so that the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`
- Attacker controls: a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response
- Exploit idea: the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
