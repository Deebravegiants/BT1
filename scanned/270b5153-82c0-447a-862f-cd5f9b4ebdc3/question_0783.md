# Q783: Owner-fee bypass via deposit_and_stake under many account ping heavy dust threshold

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker time `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::deposit_and_stake()` with a third party or attacker-owned helper repeatedly inserts public `ping()` calls between every economic step and dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding so reward settlement occurs while the attacker is in or out of the pool at precisely the profitable moment, effectively bypassing the intended owner fee or making other stakers absorb a larger fee share than the attacker's capital should bear?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::deposit_and_stake` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_deposit`, `internal_stake`, and `internal_ping` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping` and owner-fee share minting in `reward_fee_fraction.multiply(total_reward)`
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::deposit_and_stake()`
- Attacker controls: attached deposit size, split across attacker accounts, follow-up unstake timing, and reward-settlement timing; sixteen attacker EOAs splitting the same total capital into many dust positions; a third party or attacker-owned helper repeatedly inserts public `ping()` calls between every economic step; dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding
- Exploit idea: Test whether the public call order around `internal_ping()` lets the attacker enter after fee dilution but exit before bearing the matching fee-adjusted economics.
- Invariant to test: Owner fee should be collected proportionally from the rewarded stake base, and public settlement timing must not let one user offload that fee burden onto others.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Fee payment bypass
- Fast validation: Run paired simulations with the same reward and stake set, varying only whether `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::deposit_and_stake()` happens before or after `ping()`; compare attacker net value and owner fee collected.
