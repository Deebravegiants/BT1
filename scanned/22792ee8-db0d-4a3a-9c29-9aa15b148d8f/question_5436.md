# Q5436: shop — shop never domain-validated via Bearer prefix games

## Question
Can an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`, make `JwtPayload#shop` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
