# Q2867: get — version chosen per call via path prefix admin/

## Question
Can a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input, make `Clients::Rest::Admin#get` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#get`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input
- Attacker controls: a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely
- Exploit idea: the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a user-supplied resource id containing `/`, `?` or `#` cannot change the recorded request path beyond one segment
