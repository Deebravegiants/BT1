# Q1003: offline_session_id — key is predictable via omitted id token

## Question
Does `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch at `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation? Show that `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
