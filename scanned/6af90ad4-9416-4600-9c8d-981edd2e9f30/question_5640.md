# Q5640: set_property — query forwarded verbatim via attribute name with punctuation

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base#set_property` from `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data with a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting: because `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting
- Exploit idea: `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
