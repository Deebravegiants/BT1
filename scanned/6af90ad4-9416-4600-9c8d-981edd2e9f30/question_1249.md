# Q1249: request — attacker-steered retry loop via api_host config

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere to `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, does `Clients::HttpClient#request` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere
- Exploit idea: response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
