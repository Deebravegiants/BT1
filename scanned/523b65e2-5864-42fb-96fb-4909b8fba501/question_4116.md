# Q4116: zip via redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `zip` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
