# Q3264: interest-rate via supply-collateral-add: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `interest-rate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
