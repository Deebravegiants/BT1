# Q3231: validate_auth_callback — session id derived from callback input via expired cookie

## Question
Can a `SessionCookie` presented after its 60-second `expires` has passed, which the gem never re-checks on the callback side, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, make `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: a `SessionCookie` presented after its 60-second `expires` has passed, which the gem never re-checks on the callback side
- Exploit idea: `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the returned `SessionCookie#value` is never equal to `session.id` for an embedded app, and that the cookie is cleared
