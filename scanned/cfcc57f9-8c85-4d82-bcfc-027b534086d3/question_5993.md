# Q5993: shop — shop handed to handler unverified via own-shop signed body

## Question
Starting from `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header, can an unprivileged attacker supply a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers so that `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch? Determine whether BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on still holds through `Webhooks::Request#shop`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shop`
- Entrypoint: `Request#shop`, reading the unsigned `shopify-shop-domain` / `x-shopify-shop-domain` header
- Attacker controls: a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
