Now I have enough context to analyze the vulnerability. Let me verify the exact `getAssetUnstaking` logic and the `getQueuedWithdrawals` return type.

### Title
`NodeDelegator.getAssetUnstaking` Uses Raw `scaledShares` for `beaconChainETHStrategy` Without Applying Current `beaconChainSlashingFactor`, Overstating ETH in Withdrawal Queue and Inflating rsETH Price — (`contracts/NodeDelegator.sol`)

---

### Summary

`getAssetUnstaking` reads `scaledShares` from EigenLayer's `getQueuedWithdrawals` and returns them directly as the ETH amount in the withdrawal queue. Per EigenLayer's slashing model, `scaledShares` must be multiplied by the current `maxMagnitude × beaconChainSlashingFactor` at completion time to obtain the actual ETH. If a beacon chain slash checkpoint is processed after a withdrawal is queued, the `beaconChainSlashingFactor` decreases, so `completeUnstaking` will receive less ETH than `getAssetUnstaking` reported. This inflates `getTotalAssetDeposits`, which inflates `rsETHPrice`, causing new depositors to receive fewer rsETH than the true TVL warrants.

---

### Finding Description

**Root cause — `getAssetUnstaking` (NodeDelegator.sol lines 405–427):**

```solidity
uint256 sharesToUnstake = withdrawalShares[withdrawalIndex][strategyIndex];
amount += strategyAsset == LRTConstants.ETH_TOKEN
    ? sharesToUnstake                              // ← raw scaledShares, no slashing adjustment
    : strategy.sharesToUnderlyingView(sharesToUnstake);
``` [1](#0-0) 

`withdrawalShares` comes from `_getDelegationManager().getQueuedWithdrawals(address(this))`, which returns the `scaledShares` field of the `Withdrawal` struct. [2](#0-1) 

The EigenLayer `Withdrawal` struct documents this explicitly:

> "these scaledShares need to be multiplied by the operator's maxMagnitude and beaconChainScalingFactor at completion … scaledShares = sharesToWithdraw / (maxMagnitude × beaconChainScalingFactor) at queue time." [3](#0-2) 

`SlashingLib.scaleForCompleteWithdrawal` encodes the required adjustment:

```solidity
function scaleForCompleteWithdrawal(uint256 scaledShares, uint256 slashingFactor) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return scaledShares.mulWad(slashingFactor);
}
``` [4](#0-3) 

**Contrast with `getEffectivePodShares`**, which correctly calls `getWithdrawableShares` on the DelegationManager — a function that already applies the current slashing factor — for the *staked* (non-queued) portion: [5](#0-4) 

The two accounting paths are therefore inconsistent: staked ETH is slash-adjusted; queued ETH is not.

**Propagation chain:**

1. `getETHDistributionData` accumulates `getAssetUnstaking(ETH_TOKEN)` into `ethUnstakingFromEigenLayer`. [6](#0-5) 

2. `getTotalAssetDeposits` sums `assetStakedInEigenLayer + assetUnstakingFromEigenLayer`. [7](#0-6) 

3. `LRTOracle._getTotalEthInProtocol` calls `getTotalAssetDeposits` for every supported asset and uses the result to compute `rsETHPrice`. [8](#0-7) 

4. `getRsETHAmountToMint` divides by `rsETHPrice`, so an inflated price yields fewer rsETH minted per ETH deposited. [9](#0-8) 

---

### Impact Explanation

After a beacon chain slash checkpoint is processed (reducing `beaconChainSlashingFactor`), the ETH amount reported in the withdrawal queue is overstated by a factor of `1 / newBeaconChainSlashingFactor`. This inflates `rsETHPrice`. New depositors receive fewer rsETH than the true backing warrants. When `completeUnstaking` eventually settles, the actual ETH received is lower than what was counted, causing rsETH price to drop — potentially triggering the downside-protection pause in `_updateRsETHPrice`. [10](#0-9) 

No funds are permanently lost (the slash loss itself is an EigenLayer-level event), but the protocol misstates its TVL and delivers fewer rsETH than promised to depositors who transact during the window between checkpoint processing and `completeUnstaking`. This fits **Low — Contract fails to deliver promised returns, but doesn't lose value**.

---

### Likelihood Explanation

Requires: (a) a validator operated by the NDC's EigenPod to be slashed on the beacon chain, (b) a checkpoint to be started and completed (`startCheckpoint` / `verifyCheckpointProofs`) so the `beaconChainSlashingFactor` is updated on-chain, and (c) a withdrawal to already be queued at that point. All three conditions are realistic in production but not trivially triggered. Likelihood is **Low**.

---

### Recommendation

In `getAssetUnstaking`, for the `beaconChainETHStrategy` path, apply the current `beaconChainSlashingFactor` to `scaledShares` before accumulating:

```solidity
uint64 slashingFactor = _getEigenPodManager().beaconChainSlashingFactor(address(this));
amount += uint256(sharesToUnstake).mulWad(slashingFactor);
```

This mirrors how `getEffectivePodShares` obtains slash-adjusted shares via `getWithdrawableShares`, and how `SlashingLib.scaleForCompleteWithdrawal` is applied at completion time.

---

### Proof of Concept

```
1. Deploy fork of mainnet (post-EigenLayer slashing upgrade).
2. NDC stakes 32 ETH via EigenPod; verifyWithdrawalCredentials confirms 32e18 deposit shares.
3. Call initiateUnstaking(beaconChainETHStrategy, 32e18 depositShares).
   → Withdrawal struct stored with scaledShares = 32e18 / (1 * 1) = 32e18.
4. Simulate beacon chain slash: reduce validator balance by 10%.
5. Call startCheckpoint + verifyCheckpointProofs on the EigenPod.
   → beaconChainSlashingFactor updated to 0.9e18.
6. Call updateRSETHPrice.
   → getAssetUnstaking returns 32e18 (scaledShares, unadjusted).
   → getTotalAssetDeposits counts 32 ETH in queue.
   → rsETHPrice inflated.
7. New depositor sends 1 ETH; receives rsETH computed against inflated price.
8. Call completeUnstaking.
   → EigenLayer delivers 32e18 * 0.9 = 28.8 ETH (slash applied).
   → ethLyingInUnstakingVault = 28.8 ETH; queue contribution drops to 0.
   → getTotalAssetDeposits decreases by 3.2 ETH.
   → rsETHPrice drops; depositor from step 7 holds rsETH worth less than 1 ETH.
9. Assert: rsETHPrice(after step 6) > rsETHPrice(after step 8).
   Assert: rsETH minted in step 7 < rsETH that would have been minted at true price.
```
