# Q2917: getAssetDistributionData Failed External Call Ordering Distribution Loop daily P2917

## Question
Can an unprivileged depositor or caller of public view used by integrations enter through `depositAsset and oracle/accounting flows read getAssetDistributionData(asset)` while controlling asset, timing, and balances placed in pool/vault paths through public flows and force an external transfer/withdraw/deposit call to fail after local accounting mutates, causing `contracts/LRTDepositPool.sol::getAssetDistributionData` to break the invariant that failed integrations cannot leave burned rsETH, wrong counters, or inaccessible funds; specifically, distribution loop must not violate backing, queue, yield, or liquidity accounting for getAssetDistributionData, leading to block stuffing? Probe condition: daily mint limit route; amount case 1 gwei; timing one second after daily reset; caller model EOA caller.

## Target
- File/function: contracts/LRTDepositPool.sol::getAssetDistributionData
- Entrypoint: depositAsset and oracle/accounting flows read getAssetDistributionData(asset)
- Attacker controls: asset, timing, and balances placed in pool/vault paths through public flows; scenario: force an external transfer/withdraw/deposit call to fail after local accounting mutates; validation style: one transaction using a contract wallet and controlled calldata; probe condition: daily mint limit route; amount case 1 gwei; timing one second after daily reset; caller model EOA caller
- Exploit idea: Use single transaction to exercise the failed external call ordering path against getAssetDistributionData and look for distribution loop breaking value conservation or liveness.
- Invariant to test: failed integrations cannot leave burned rsETH, wrong counters, or inaccessible funds; specifically, distribution loop must not violate backing, queue, yield, or liquidity accounting for getAssetDistributionData
- Expected Immunefi impact: Low. Block stuffing
- Fast validation: measure loops over nodeDelegatorQueue/user queues and assert bounded gas under max configured counts Use probe condition: daily mint limit route; amount case 1 gwei; timing one second after daily reset; caller model EOA caller.
