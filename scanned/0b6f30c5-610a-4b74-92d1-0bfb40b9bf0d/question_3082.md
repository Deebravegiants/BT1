# Q3082: request_url — guard order via api_version override

## Question
Does `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an `api_version:` argument derived from request input, changing the base path and the loaded resource classes at the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/`? Show that the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/`
- Attacker controls: an `api_version:` argument derived from request input, changing the base path and the loaded resource classes
- Exploit idea: the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
