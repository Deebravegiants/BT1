# Q1897: make_request — version chosen per call via path prefix admin/

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request` through the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers` while supplying a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely, so that the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely
- Exploit idea: the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
