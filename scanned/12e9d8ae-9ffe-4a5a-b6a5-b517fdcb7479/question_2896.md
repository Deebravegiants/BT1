# Q2896: setup — version becomes a path via rest_disabled

## Question
Trace `Context.setup` from `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope` with the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises: because `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.setup`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`
- Attacker controls: the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises
- Exploit idea: `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `activate_session` is cleared at the end of a request cycle so a pooled thread cannot serve a stale tenant
