# Q0447: calculate-asset-notional-value via collateral-add: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
`calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, use that to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `collateral-add` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calculate-asset-notional-value` touches, run `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
