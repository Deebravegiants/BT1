# Q3650: protocol pv do_ckd_coordinator a one-time artifact can

## Question
Can a below-threshold Byzantine participant node cooperating in an otherwise honest request flow enter through `request_app_private_key` and use the app public key variant, derivation path, domain_id, predecessor identity, repeated submission timing, and request batching to drive the code path through `crates/threshold-signatures/src/confidential_key_derivation/protocol_pv.rs::do_ckd_coordinator` so that a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime, breaking the invariant that completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch, and leading to Bypass of threshold signature requirements?

## Target
- File/function: crates/threshold-signatures/src/confidential_key_derivation/protocol_pv.rs:38::do_ckd_coordinator
- Entrypoint: `request_app_private_key`
- Attacker controls: the app public key variant, derivation path, domain_id, predecessor identity, repeated submission timing, and request batching
- Exploit idea: a one-time artifact can be consumed more than once or after its intended lifetime
- Invariant to test: completed, expired, or superseded state must never be reusable in a later request or epoch
- Expected Immunefi impact: Bypass of threshold signature requirements
- Fast validation: force a retry or restart boundary, then resend the old artifact and verify whether it still affects request resolution or signature completion
