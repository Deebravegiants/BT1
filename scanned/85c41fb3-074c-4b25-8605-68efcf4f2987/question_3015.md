# Q3015: tee fetch_tee_accounts_with_retry equivalent-looking identities bypass equality

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `submit_participant_info / verify_tee` and use attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification to drive the code path through `crates/node/src/indexer/tee.rs::fetch_tee_accounts_with_retry` so that equivalent-looking identities bypass equality or allowlist checks, breaking the invariant that identity-bearing strings and byte wrappers must be normalized once, before any security comparison, and leading to Unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: crates/node/src/indexer/tee.rs:109::fetch_tee_accounts_with_retry
- Entrypoint: `submit_participant_info / verify_tee`
- Attacker controls: attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification
- Exploit idea: equivalent-looking identities bypass equality or allowlist checks
- Invariant to test: identity-bearing strings and byte wrappers must be normalized once, before any security comparison
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: exercise casing, prefix, leading-zero, and compressed/uncompressed variants and compare equality, hashing, and allowlist outcomes
