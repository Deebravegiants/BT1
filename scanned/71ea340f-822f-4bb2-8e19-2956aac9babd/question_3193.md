# Q3193: set_property — template selection is textual via primary key value

## Question
Starting from `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, can an unprivileged attacker supply the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path so that `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended? Determine whether AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right still holds through `Rest::Base#set_property`, and whether the result reaches High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: the primary-key value, which decides `deduce_write_verb` between `:put` and `:post` and is interpolated into the write path
- Exploit idea: `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
