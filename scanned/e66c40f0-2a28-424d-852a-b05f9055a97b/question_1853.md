# Q1853: callback_address — scheme-carrying path trusted via response-controlled callbackUrl

## Question
Trace `Registrations::Http#callback_address` from `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host` with the `callbackUrl` returned by the check query, compared against the desired address to decide whether to re-register: because a path that already looks like a URL is used verbatim as the delivery destination for the merchant's webhook data, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: the `callbackUrl` returned by the check query, compared against the desired address to decide whether to re-register
- Exploit idea: a path that already looks like a URL is used verbatim as the delivery destination for the merchant's webhook data
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a regex-metacharacter host name does not widen what `callback_address` accepts
