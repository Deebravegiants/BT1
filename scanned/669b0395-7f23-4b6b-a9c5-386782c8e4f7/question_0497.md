# Q497: implied_scope — implication is textual via whitespace and empties

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Auth::AuthScopes#implied_scope` through `implied_scope`, whose regex `\A(unauthenticated_)?write_(.*)\z` manufactures a read scope from a write scope while supplying scope strings with padding, empty entries or repeated delimiters, since only `strip` and `reject(&:empty?)` are applied, so that `implied_scope` derives an implication from string shape alone, with no allow-list of real Shopify scopes, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#implied_scope`
- Entrypoint: `implied_scope`, whose regex `\A(unauthenticated_)?write_(.*)\z` manufactures a read scope from a write scope
- Attacker controls: scope strings with padding, empty entries or repeated delimiters, since only `strip` and `reject(&:empty?)` are applied
- Exploit idea: `implied_scope` derives an implication from string shape alone, with no allow-list of real Shopify scopes
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `==` distinguishes two scope sets whose expanded permissions differ
