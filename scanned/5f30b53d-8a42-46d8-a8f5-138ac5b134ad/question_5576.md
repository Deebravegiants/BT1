# Q5576: request — header override ordering via query/fragment injection

## Question
Can a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, make `Clients::HttpClient#request` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
