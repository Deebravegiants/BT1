# Q5776: resolve-interpolation-points via collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order reach `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the three `price-feeds` buffers and their order, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
