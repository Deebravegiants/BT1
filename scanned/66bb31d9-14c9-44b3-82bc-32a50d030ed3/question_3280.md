# Q3280: accrue-debt-asset via accrue: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block reach `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `accrue` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `accrue` with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
