# Q2152: get — path built by interpolation via tries argument

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a `tries:` value that lengthens the retry loop around an authenticated request to `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input, does `Clients::Rest::Admin#get` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#get`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input
- Attacker controls: a `tries:` value that lengthens the retry loop around an authenticated request
- Exploit idea: resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
