# Q836: keychain derivation scope expansion via createKeychain

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `createKeychain` in `features/keychain/module/keychain.js` through signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action and supply crafted `name`, `port`, and `signature` values that make the SDK sign with a different seed, key, or wallet account than the user approved, violating the invariant that cached decrypted material must be cleared on lock, clear, and account-boundary changes, and causing `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/keychain/module/keychain.js::createKeychain
- Entrypoint: signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action
- Attacker controls: external private-key or seed-adjacent material accepted through a normal signing-related flow
- Exploit idea: make the SDK sign with a different seed, key, or wallet account than the user approved
- Invariant to test: cached decrypted material must be cleared on lock, clear, and account-boundary changes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: fuzz derivation-path and key-identifier inputs and assert the returned key scope never exceeds the approved request
