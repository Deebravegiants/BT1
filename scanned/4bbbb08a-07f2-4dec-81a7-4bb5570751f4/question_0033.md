# Q33: current_session_id — unauthenticated bytes become the key via chosen cookie value

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.current_session_id` from `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves with the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check: because the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.current_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check
- Exploit idea: the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
