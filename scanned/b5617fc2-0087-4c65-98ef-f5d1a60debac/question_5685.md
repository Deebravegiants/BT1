# Q5685: get_path — cursor trusted via read-only attribute

## Question
Starting from `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids, can an unprivileged attacker supply an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update` so that page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Rest::Base.get_path`, and whether the result reaches High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids
- Attacker controls: an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update`
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
