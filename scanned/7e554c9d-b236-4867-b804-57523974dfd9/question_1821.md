# Q1821: insert via liquidate-multi: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), drive `insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) — which rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `insert` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
