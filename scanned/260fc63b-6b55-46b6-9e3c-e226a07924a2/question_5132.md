# Q5132: initialize — string interpolation, not URL joining via base_path argument

## Question
Starting from `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, can an unprivileged attacker supply the `base_path:` argument, concatenated into `@base_uri_and_path` with no separator normalisation so that the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`
- Attacker controls: the `base_path:` argument, concatenated into `@base_uri_and_path` with no separator normalisation
- Exploit idea: the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
