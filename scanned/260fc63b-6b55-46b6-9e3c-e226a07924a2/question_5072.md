# Q5072: append_first_party_development_headers — attacker-steered retry loop via api_host config

## Question
Can an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, make `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere
- Exploit idea: response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
