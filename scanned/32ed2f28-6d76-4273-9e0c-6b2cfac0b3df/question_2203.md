# Q2203: oracle-last-update via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `oracle-last-update` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
