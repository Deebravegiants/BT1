# Q4768: send-tokens via collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
