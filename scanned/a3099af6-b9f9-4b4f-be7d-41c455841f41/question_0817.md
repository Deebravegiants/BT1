# Q0817: snapshot_fields_from_files grows memory without an enforced bound (snapshot_utils.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `snapshot_fields_from_files` in `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` with a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot, and grow the buffer `snapshot_fields_from_files` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_utils.rs` -> `snapshot_fields_from_files()` (around line 1162)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: a sequence that writes, deletes, and rewrites the same key inside one slot
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `snapshot_fields_from_files` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can make compute-budget, cost-model, or fee accounting charge materially less than the real CPU, memory, or account-load work performed, exhausting block capacity or node resources below true cost.
