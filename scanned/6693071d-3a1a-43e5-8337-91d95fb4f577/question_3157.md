# Q3157: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — key is predictable via Bearer interior match

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` through `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims while supplying an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded, so that `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
