# Q3664: request_url — caller headers win via case-varied prefix

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a path beginning with `Admin/` or `/admin/`, probing the exact `start_with?("admin/")` comparison after the leading-slash strip to the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/`, does `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/`
- Attacker controls: a path beginning with `Admin/` or `/admin/`, probing the exact `start_with?("admin/")` comparison after the leading-slash strip
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
