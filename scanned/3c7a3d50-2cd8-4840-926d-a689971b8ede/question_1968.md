# Q1968: mask-to-list-internal via collateral-remove-redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem reach `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-internal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
