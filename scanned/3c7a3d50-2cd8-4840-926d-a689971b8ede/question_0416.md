# Q0416: vault-accrue via liquidate-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the borrower targeted reach `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the borrower targeted varied, and assert that the value `vault-accrue` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
