# Q2682: total-assets-preview via redeem: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued, so the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `redeem` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `total-assets-preview` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
