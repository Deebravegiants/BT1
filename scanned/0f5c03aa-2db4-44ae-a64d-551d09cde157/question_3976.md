# Q3976: unregister — shared mutable registry via replayed delivery

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Registry.unregister` through `Registry.unregister(topic:, session:)`, which interpolates a `webhook_id` into a delete mutation while supplying the same signed body and `webhook-id` delivered repeatedly, so that `@registry` is process-global and mutable at runtime, so what a topic maps to can change between verification and dispatch, breaking the requirement that SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`, and ending in Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.unregister`
- Entrypoint: `Registry.unregister(topic:, session:)`, which interpolates a `webhook_id` into a delete mutation
- Attacker controls: the same signed body and `webhook-id` delivered repeatedly
- Exploit idea: `@registry` is process-global and mutable at runtime, so what a topic maps to can change between verification and dispatch
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: register two handlers, submit one signed body with each topic header, and assert dispatch follows the signature rather than the header
