# Q1944: calc-liq-collateral-repay via liquidate-multi: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `calc-liq-collateral-repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:728` -> `calc-liq-collateral-repay`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-collateral-repay` scales the repaid debt by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `calc-liq-collateral-repay` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
