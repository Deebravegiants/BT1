# Q4122: resolve via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `price-feeds` buffers across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `resolve` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
