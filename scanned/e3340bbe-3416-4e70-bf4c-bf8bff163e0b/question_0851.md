# Q851: host_name — global identity, per-request requests via expiring_offline_access_tokens

## Question
Can the `expiring_offline_access_tokens` flag, which changes token lifetime and the `expiring` body field, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`, make `Context.host_name` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that one process-wide `Context` serves every shop, so any leakage between requests crosses a tenant boundary? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.host_name`
- Entrypoint: `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`
- Attacker controls: the `expiring_offline_access_tokens` flag, which changes token lifetime and the `expiring` body field
- Exploit idea: one process-wide `Context` serves every shop, so any leakage between requests crosses a tenant boundary
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a crafted `api_version` cannot make `load_rest_resources` touch a path outside `lib/shopify_api/rest/resources`
