# Q2928: method_missing — path interpolation from ids via has_many element class

## Question
Does `Rest::Base#method_missing` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated at `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access? Show that ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated
- Exploit idea: ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
