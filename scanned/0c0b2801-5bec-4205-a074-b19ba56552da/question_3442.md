# Q3442: admin_session_token? — leeway on both ends via dest with embedded separator

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` from `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check with a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator: because a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator
- Exploit idea: a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
