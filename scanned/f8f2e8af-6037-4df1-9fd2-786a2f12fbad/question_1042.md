# Q1042: admin_session_token? — separator collision via own-shop id token

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a genuine session token issued to the attacker's own shop, signed with the same `api_secret_key` that serves every install of the app at `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check, makes `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a genuine session token issued to the attacker's own shop, signed with the same `api_secret_key` that serves every install of the app
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
