# Q1620: compute_signature — authenticity is not authorisation via non-ASCII signable string

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a signable string whose encoding (`ASCII-8BIT` vs `UTF-8`) differs between signing and verification to `compute_signature`, an `OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest` over `to_signable_string` with `Context.api_secret_key`, does `HmacValidator.compute_signature` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because a valid signature proves Shopify signed something for some shop, not that it was for this shop, this browser or this topic? Close the question on SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/hmac_validator.rb` -> `HmacValidator.compute_signature`
- Entrypoint: `compute_signature`, an `OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest` over `to_signable_string` with `Context.api_secret_key`
- Attacker controls: a signable string whose encoding (`ASCII-8BIT` vs `UTF-8`) differs between signing and verification
- Exploit idea: a valid signature proves Shopify signed something for some shop, not that it was for this shop, this browser or this topic
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: set `Context.old_api_secret_key`, sign under it, and assert `validate` accepts long after rotation
