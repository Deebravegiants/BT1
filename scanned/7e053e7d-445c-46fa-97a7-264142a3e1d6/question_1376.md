# Q1376: collateral-add via transfer: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:374` -> `collateral-add`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `collateral-add` evaluates the map write and `mask-update` as `let` bindings BEFORE `check-impl-auth`, the pause state and the amount assertion. Reach it through `transfer` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `transfer` twice with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation varied, and assert that the value `collateral-add` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
