# Q5319: uri_from_shop_domain — differential between the two entry points via scheme injection

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://` at the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`, makes `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`
- Attacker controls: a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://`
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
