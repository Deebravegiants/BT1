# Q1813: to_signable_string — header collision via relabelled topic header

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string` through `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else while supplying the `x-shopify-topic` header, which selects the handler in `Registry.process`, so that two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup, breaking the requirement that BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else
- Attacker controls: the `x-shopify-topic` header, which selects the handler in `Registry.process`
- Exploit idea: two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
