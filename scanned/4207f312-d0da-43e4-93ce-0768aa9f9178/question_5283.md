# Q5283: base_find — cursor trusted via attribute name with punctuation

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.base_find` from `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params` with a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting: because page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.base_find`
- Entrypoint: `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`
- Attacker controls: a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
