# Q4745: mask-pos via repay: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), controlling `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), drive `mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) — which maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET — to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, breaking the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `repay` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
