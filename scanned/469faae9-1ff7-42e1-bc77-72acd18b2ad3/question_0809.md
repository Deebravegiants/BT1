# Q809: setup? — setup? is a presence check via thread-local session

## Question
Can the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `setup?`, which only checks that four strings are non-empty, make `Context.setup?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.setup?`
- Entrypoint: `setup?`, which only checks that four strings are non-empty
- Attacker controls: the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread
- Exploit idea: `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a crafted `api_version` cannot make `load_rest_resources` touch a path outside `lib/shopify_api/rest/resources`
