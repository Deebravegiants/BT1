# Q4678: calc-index-next via liquidate-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
