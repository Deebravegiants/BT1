# Q3387: shopify_user_id — type assumptions via non-Shopify dest

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `dest` naming a host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, since `JwtPayload` never calls `ShopValidator` at `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`, makes `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` naming a host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, since `JwtPayload` never calls `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
