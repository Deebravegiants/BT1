# Q4406: parsed_body — shop handed to handler unverified via underscore/dash aliasing

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits header names that collide after `downcase.sub("http_","").gsub("_","-")`, e.g. `HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_TOPIC` vs `X-Shopify-Topic` to `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification, does `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body`
- Entrypoint: `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification
- Attacker controls: header names that collide after `downcase.sub("http_","").gsub("_","-")`, e.g. `HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_TOPIC` vs `X-Shopify-Topic`
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `to_signable_string` equals the exact bytes later returned by `parsed_body.to_json`-round-tripped input, and diff on mismatch
