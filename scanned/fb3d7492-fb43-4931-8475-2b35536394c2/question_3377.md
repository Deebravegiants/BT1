# Q3377: jwt_session_id — unauthenticated bytes become the key via guessed online key

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint to `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation, does `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
