# Q4833: method_missing — dynamic dispatch on response data via params hash

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `params:` hash, forwarded as the outgoing query string to `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access, does `Rest::Base#method_missing` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: the `params:` hash, forwarded as the outgoing query string
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
