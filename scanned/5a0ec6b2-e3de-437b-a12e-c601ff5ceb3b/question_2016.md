# Q2016: add-user-collateral via liquidate: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `debt-amount` reach `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `debt-amount` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `add-user-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
