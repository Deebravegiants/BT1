# Q5864: system-borrow via liquidate: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `borrower`, any third-party principal reach `system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:865` -> `system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `system-borrow` independently computes `scaled-amount` with `mul-div-up` from its own `index`, duplicating the market's own scaling of the same borrow. Reach it through `liquidate` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate` twice with `borrower`, any third-party principal varied, and assert that the value `system-borrow` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
