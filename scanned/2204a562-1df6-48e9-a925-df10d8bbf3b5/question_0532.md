# Q532: shopify_user_id — type assumptions via missing claims

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` through `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?` while supplying a token omitting `sid`, `jti` or `sub`, exercising the `T.let(..., T.nilable(String))` paths, so that `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a token omitting `sid`, `jti` or `sub`, exercising the `T.let(..., T.nilable(String))` paths
- Exploit idea: `T.let` casts assume claim types; a differently-typed claim reaches downstream string interpolation
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
