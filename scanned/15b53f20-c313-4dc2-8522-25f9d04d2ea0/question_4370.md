# Q4370: get_path_ids — read-only filter applied late via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
Does `Rest::Base.get_path_ids` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name at `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires? Show that the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path_ids`
- Entrypoint: `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
