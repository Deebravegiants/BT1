# Q4605: get_path_ids — dynamic dispatch on response data via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name at `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires, makes `Rest::Base.get_path_ids` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path_ids`
- Entrypoint: `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
