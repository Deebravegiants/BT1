# Q4381: validate_auth_callback — no replay window via unsanitised shop param

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!` at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, makes `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Exploit idea: nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - session fixation / forced OAuth completion binding a victim browser to an attacker-chosen shop (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
