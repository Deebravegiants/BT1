# Q383: activate_session — setup? is a presence check via expiring_offline_access_tokens

## Question
Trace `Context.activate_session` from `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` with the `expiring_offline_access_tokens` flag, which changes token lifetime and the `expiring` body field: because `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.activate_session`
- Entrypoint: `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`
- Attacker controls: the `expiring_offline_access_tokens` flag, which changes token lifetime and the `expiring` body field
- Exploit idea: `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a crafted `api_version` cannot make `load_rest_resources` touch a path outside `lib/shopify_api/rest/resources`
