# Q2813: index stale address cache reuse via serialize

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp and manipulate `xpub`, `port`, and request ordering so that `serialize` in `features/public-key-provider/module/store/formats/serialization/index.ts` reuse trust, favorite, or auto-approve state from one origin for another origin or another account, breaking the invariant that asset-scope expansion must require explicit user approval for the final returned scope, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/public-key-provider/module/store/formats/serialization/index.ts::serialize
- Entrypoint: provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp
- Attacker controls: an address, xpub, or public-key request with attacker-chosen account and asset parameters
- Exploit idea: reuse trust, favorite, or auto-approve state from one origin for another origin or another account
- Invariant to test: asset-scope expansion must require explicit user approval for the final returned scope
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: request a narrower asset/account scope first, then a broader one, and assert the module never silently widens the approved result
