# Q5716: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — validator returns a non-Shopify host via userinfo bypass

## Question
Can a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment, make `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: stub_request on the attacker host, call the flow, and `assert_not_requested` any host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
