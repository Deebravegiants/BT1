# Q0044: debt-remove-scaled via repay: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `repay` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list varied, and assert that the value `debt-remove-scaled` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
