# Q2623: max_concurrent_connections can strand user funds permanently (qos.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `max_concurrent_connections` in `streamer/src/nonblocking/qos.rs` with a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account, and drive the target account into a state that no later instruction will accept, so that the invariant "Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `streamer/src/nonblocking/qos.rs` -> `max_concurrent_connections()` (around line 59)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: a zero-lamport or exactly-rent-exempt-minus-one account
- Exploit idea: Drive an account through `max_concurrent_connections` into a state no subsequent instruction accepts, so the owner can never withdraw.
- Invariant to test: Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Exhaustive state-machine test over `max_concurrent_connections`'s transitions; assert every reachable state has a path back to a withdrawable state.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can bypass account-lock, reserved-key, writable-declaration, or loaded-accounts-data-size limits and write to or read state the transaction never declared or paid for.
