# Q2930: initialize — id and shop can disagree via shop with separator

## Question
Can a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable, make `Auth::Session#initialize` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable
- Attacker controls: a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair
- Exploit idea: `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
