# Q3485: receive-underlying via deposit: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, drive `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) — which pulls the underlying from a named account — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `deposit` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
