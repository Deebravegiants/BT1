# Q0674: vault-system-borrow via borrow: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) mint shares whose backing was never received? `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `borrow` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `vault-system-borrow` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
