# Q3129: zip via liquidate-redeem: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the borrower targeted, drive `zip` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226) — which pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:226` -> `zip`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `zip` pairs the utilization and rate point lists element by element. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `zip` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
