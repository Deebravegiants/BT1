# Q459: initialize — canonicalisation gap via unsigned extra params

## Question
Can any query parameter the app reads that is not one of `code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string, make `AuthQuery#initialize` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the string reconstructed by `URI.encode_www_form` is not byte-identical to what Shopify signed, so verification depends on incidental encoding? The binding to test is SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string
- Attacker controls: any query parameter the app reads that is not one of `code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp`
- Exploit idea: the string reconstructed by `URI.encode_www_form` is not byte-identical to what Shopify signed, so verification depends on incidental encoding
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: build the query two ways, assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both, and diff the two `to_signable_string` outputs
