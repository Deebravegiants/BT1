# Q3630: offline_session_id — no shop cross-check via guessed offline key

## Question
Can a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation, make `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
