# Q2174: time checked_add mixed request classes bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `sign` and use payload bytes, derivation path, domain_id, attached deposit, predecessor identity, repeated submission timing, and overlapping requests to drive the code path through `crates/contract/src/primitives/time.rs::checked_add` so that mixed request classes bypass the intended validation or return path, breaking the invariant that request-kind separation must hold across storage, callback wiring, and response resolution, and leading to Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability?

## Target
- File/function: crates/contract/src/primitives/time.rs:16::checked_add
- Entrypoint: `sign`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes, derivation path, domain_id, attached deposit, predecessor identity, repeated submission timing, and overlapping requests
- Exploit idea: mixed request classes bypass the intended validation or return path
- Invariant to test: request-kind separation must hold across storage, callback wiring, and response resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability
- Fast validation: enqueue different request kinds with colliding timing or similar serialized bodies and see whether the wrong resolver accepts the completion
