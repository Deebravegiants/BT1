# Q5769: calc-utilization via redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, drive `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) — which divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets — to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-utilization` touches, run `redeem` with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
