# Q3146: accrue-collateral-asset via collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel, so the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) varied, and assert that the value `accrue-collateral-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
