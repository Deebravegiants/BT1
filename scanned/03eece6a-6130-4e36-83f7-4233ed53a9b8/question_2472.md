# Q2472: receive-underlying via liquidate-redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the redemption receiver reach `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it pulls the underlying from a named account, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the redemption receiver across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `receive-underlying` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
