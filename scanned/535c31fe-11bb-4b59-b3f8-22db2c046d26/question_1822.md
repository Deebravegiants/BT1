# Q1822: == — temp restores unconditionally via online/offline flip

## Question
Does `Auth::Session#==` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?` at `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches? Show that the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#==`
- Entrypoint: `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches
- Attacker controls: an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?`
- Exploit idea: the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `expired?` is true, not false, for a session with no expiry once its token is past any plausible lifetime
