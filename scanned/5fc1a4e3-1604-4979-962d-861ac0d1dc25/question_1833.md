# Q1833: append_first_party_development_headers — header override ordering via path traversal segments

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling `../` or `%2e%2e%2f` segments in `path` that climb out of the versioned base path at `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`, makes `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: `../` or `%2e%2e%2f` segments in `path` that climb out of the versioned base path
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
