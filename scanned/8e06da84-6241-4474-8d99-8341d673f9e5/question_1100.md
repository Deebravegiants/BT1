# Q1100: validate_signature — truthiness instead of presence via length-varied digest

## Question
Starting from the private `validate_signature`, which calls `OpenSSL.secure_compare(computed_signature, received_signature)`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling so that the guard tests truthiness of `hmac`, not that it is a well-formed digest of the right length? Determine whether SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` still holds through `HmacValidator.validate_signature`, and whether the result reaches Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/hmac_validator.rb` -> `HmacValidator.validate_signature`
- Entrypoint: the private `validate_signature`, which calls `OpenSSL.secure_compare(computed_signature, received_signature)`
- Attacker controls: a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling
- Exploit idea: the guard tests truthiness of `hmac`, not that it is a well-formed digest of the right length
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: sign a body as UTF-8, re-present it as ASCII-8BIT, and assert the verification verdict is unchanged
