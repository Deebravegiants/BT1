# Q718: == — implication is textual via delimiter in a scope name

## Question
Can a scope name containing `,` so one entry becomes two, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `AuthScopes#==` and `hash`, which compare only `compressed_scopes`, make `Auth::AuthScopes#==` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `implied_scope` derives an implication from string shape alone, with no allow-list of real Shopify scopes? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#==`
- Entrypoint: `AuthScopes#==` and `hash`, which compare only `compressed_scopes`
- Attacker controls: a scope name containing `,` so one entry becomes two
- Exploit idea: `implied_scope` derives an implication from string shape alone, with no allow-list of real Shopify scopes
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `AuthScopes.new('write_x').covers?(AuthScopes.new('read_x'))` cannot be reached with a fabricated `x`
