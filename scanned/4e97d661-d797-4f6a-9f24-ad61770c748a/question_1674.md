# Q1674: debt-remove-scaled via collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-remove-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:473` -> `debt-remove-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `debt-remove-scaled` clears the debt bit only when the remaining scaled debt is exactly zero. Reach it through `collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `debt-remove-scaled` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
