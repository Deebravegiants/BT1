# Q1985: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — no shop cross-check via guessed offline key

## Question
Can a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims, make `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `offline_<victim>.myshopify.com`, matching exactly what `offline_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
