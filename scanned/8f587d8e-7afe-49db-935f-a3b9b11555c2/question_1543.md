# Q1543: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — caller decides identity shape via online flag flip

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits control of whether the caller passes `online: true` or `false`, selecting between the online and offline key for the same token to `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims, does `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: control of whether the caller passes `online: true` or `false`, selecting between the online and offline key for the same token
- Exploit idea: the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
