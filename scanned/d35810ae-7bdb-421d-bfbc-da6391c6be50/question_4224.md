# Q4224: mask-to-list-iter via liquidate-multi: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the trait principals supplied per entry across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-iter` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
