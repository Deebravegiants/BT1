# Q1541: subset via collateral-add: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), controlling call ordering within the block, drive `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) — which tests bitmask containment — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-add` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with call ordering within the block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
