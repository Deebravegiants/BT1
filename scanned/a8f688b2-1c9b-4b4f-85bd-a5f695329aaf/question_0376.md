# Q0376: accrue-debt-asset via call-ststx-ratio: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block reach `accrue-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:262` -> `accrue-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block
- Exploit idea: `accrue-debt-asset` calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside a fold whose accumulator ignores the result. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `call-ststx-ratio` with whether the ratio is fetched before or after other state changes in the block, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
