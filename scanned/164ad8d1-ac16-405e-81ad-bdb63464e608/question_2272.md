# Q2272: tee monitor_allowed_hashes old stored bytes silently

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `submit_participant_info / verify_tee` and use attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification to drive the code path through `crates/node/src/indexer/tee.rs::monitor_allowed_hashes` so that old stored bytes silently change meaning in security-sensitive state, breaking the invariant that durable serialized state must remain backward-compatible without changing the authorization meaning of existing bytes, and leading to Contract execution flows?

## Target
- File/function: crates/node/src/indexer/tee.rs:18::monitor_allowed_hashes
- Entrypoint: `submit_participant_info / verify_tee`
- Attacker controls: attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification
- Exploit idea: old stored bytes silently change meaning in security-sensitive state
- Invariant to test: durable serialized state must remain backward-compatible without changing the authorization meaning of existing bytes
- Expected Immunefi impact: Contract execution flows
- Fast validation: persist crafted state bytes through one representation, reload through the next conversion path, and diff the resulting runtime security state
