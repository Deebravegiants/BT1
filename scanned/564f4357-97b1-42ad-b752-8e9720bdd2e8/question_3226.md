# Q3226: num_lookup_tables can be driven into unbounded work (runtime_transaction.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `num_lookup_tables` in `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction.rs` with a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing, and make `num_lookup_tables` iterate over an attacker-sized set far past the per-slot budget, so that the invariant "Iteration count in `num_lookup_tables` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction.rs` -> `num_lookup_tables()` (around line 135)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a missing entry that makes the loader fall back to a default instead of failing
- Exploit idea: Grow the attacker-controlled collection `num_lookup_tables` iterates so a single transaction pins the replay thread far past the slot budget.
- Invariant to test: Iteration count in `num_lookup_tables` is bounded by a constant or by a value the transaction pays for.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Benchmark `num_lookup_tables` as the attacker-controlled size grows; assert runtime stays under the per-slot budget.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can send a valid-looking transaction that panics, overflows, aborts, or wedges banking/replay on every node, halting consensus until human intervention.
