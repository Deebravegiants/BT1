# Q3080: jwt_session_id — no shop cross-check via guessed online key

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` through `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation while supplying a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint, so that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
