# Q3311: cookie_session_id — no shop cross-check via shop casing

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` through `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key while supplying a shop value differing only in case or trailing dot from the stored key, since keys are compared as raw strings, so that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a shop value differing only in case or trailing dot from the stored key, since keys are compared as raw strings
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
