# Q3107: sanitize_config confuses account types or owners (sanitize_config.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `sanitize_config` in `runtime-transaction/src/sanitize_config.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and have `sanitize_config` deserialize an account of the wrong owner or discriminant as valid, so that the invariant "`sanitize_config` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/sanitize_config.rs` -> `sanitize_config()` (around line 14)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Pass an account of a different type/owner that `sanitize_config` deserializes successfully, so a later check trusts the wrong discriminant.
- Invariant to test: `sanitize_config` validates owner and discriminant before trusting deserialized content.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Feed every other account layout into `sanitize_config` and assert each is rejected rather than silently reinterpreted.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft a transaction whose fee, rent, rollback, or balance-commit accounting in the SVM lifecycle moves, mints, duplicates, or destroys lamports the signer does not own.
