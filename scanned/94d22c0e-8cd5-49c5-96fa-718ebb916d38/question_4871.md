# Q4871: admin_session_token? — claim trusted as identity via leeway window

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf` at `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check, makes `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf`
- Exploit idea: a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
