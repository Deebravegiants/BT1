# Q4297: find-asset via collateral-remove: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers, drive `find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) — which returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic` — to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, breaking the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the `price-feeds` buffers, then read `find-asset` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
