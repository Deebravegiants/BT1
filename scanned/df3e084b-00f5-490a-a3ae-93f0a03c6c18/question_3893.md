# Q3893: convert-to-shares-preview via redeem: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797), controlling `amount` of shares burned, drive `convert-to-shares-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308) — which returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:308` -> `convert-to-shares-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-shares-preview` returns u0 outright when `total-assets-preview` is non-zero and supply is zero, minting nothing for a real deposit. Reach it through `redeem` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` of shares burned, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
