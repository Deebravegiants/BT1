# Q342: exchange_token — shop taken from an unvalidated claim via error-path body

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a 400 response whose `error` field steers the `invalid_subject_token` branch at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token, makes `TokenExchange.exchange_token` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `dest_shop` comes from `JwtPayload#shop` and is never passed through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, unlike the sibling `migrate_to_expiring_token`? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.exchange_token`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token
- Attacker controls: a 400 response whose `error` field steers the `invalid_subject_token` branch
- Exploit idea: `dest_shop` comes from `JwtPayload#shop` and is never passed through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, unlike the sibling `migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: mint a token whose `dest` is a non-Shopify host, call `exchange_token`, and assert no request carrying `client_secret` left for that host
