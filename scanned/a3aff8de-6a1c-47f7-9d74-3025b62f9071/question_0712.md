# Q712: make_request — prefix re-rooting via double .json

## Question
Trace `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request` from the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers` with a path already ending in `.json`, `.JSON` or `.json/`, exercising the strip-and-re-append rewrite: because the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: a path already ending in `.json`, `.JSON` or `.json/`, exercising the strip-and-re-append rewrite
- Exploit idea: the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
