# Q5406: shopify_user_id — unanchored substitution via non-Shopify dest

## Question
Does `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a `dest` naming a host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, since `JwtPayload` never calls `ShopValidator` at `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`? Show that `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` naming a host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, since `JwtPayload` never calls `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
