# Q3098: get-notional-evaluation via supply-collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-notional-evaluation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total, so the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:514` -> `get-notional-evaluation`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-notional-evaluation` folds over the ENABLED asset list, so a position row whose asset is absent from that list contributes nothing to either total. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `get-notional-evaluation` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
