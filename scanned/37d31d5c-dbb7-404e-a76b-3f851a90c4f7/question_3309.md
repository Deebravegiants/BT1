# Q3309: debt-preview via supply-collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) — which computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `debt-preview` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
