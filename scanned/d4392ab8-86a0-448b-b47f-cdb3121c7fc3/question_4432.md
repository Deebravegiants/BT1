# Q4432: mask-to-list-iter via borrow: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `borrow` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
