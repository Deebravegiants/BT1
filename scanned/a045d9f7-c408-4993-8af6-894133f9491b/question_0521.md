# Q0521: calc-utilization via accrue: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the utilization the rate is interpolated at, drive `calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) — which divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets — to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the utilization the rate is interpolated at
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `accrue` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the utilization the rate is interpolated at, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
