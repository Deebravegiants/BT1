# Q3673: request_url — header override ordering via shop.dev host

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` from the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation with a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite: because `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
