# Q0797: accrue-collateral-asset via collateral-remove-redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `min-underlying`, drive `accrue-collateral-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273) — which maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel — to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, breaking the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:273` -> `accrue-collateral-asset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-collateral-asset` maps a ztoken id to a vault id through a chain of `is-eq` tests that falls through to the u100 sentinel. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-underlying`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
