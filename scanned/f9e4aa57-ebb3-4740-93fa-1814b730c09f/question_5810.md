# Q5810: shopify_header — header collision via own-shop signed body

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header` through the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>` while supplying a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers, so that two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header`
- Entrypoint: the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`
- Attacker controls: a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers
- Exploit idea: two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `to_signable_string` equals the exact bytes later returned by `parsed_body.to_json`-round-tripped input, and diff on mismatch
