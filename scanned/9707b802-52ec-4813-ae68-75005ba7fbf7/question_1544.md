# Q1544: migrate_to_expiring_token — error branch reveals verdict via expiring flag

## Question
Can `Context.expiring_offline_access_tokens`, which changes the body sent and the session's expiry, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`, make `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Entrypoint: `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`
- Attacker controls: `Context.expiring_offline_access_tokens`, which changes the body sent and the session's expiry
- Exploit idea: distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
