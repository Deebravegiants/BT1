# Q2524: compute_signature — encoding-dependent digest via empty-string hmac

## Question
Can an empty signature string, which is truthy in Ruby and reaches `secure_compare`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `compute_signature`, an `OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest` over `to_signable_string` with `Context.api_secret_key`, make `HmacValidator.compute_signature` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `hexdigest` over a differently-encoded string yields a different digest for the same logical content? The binding to test is SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/hmac_validator.rb` -> `HmacValidator.compute_signature`
- Entrypoint: `compute_signature`, an `OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest` over `to_signable_string` with `Context.api_secret_key`
- Attacker controls: an empty signature string, which is truthy in Ruby and reaches `secure_compare`
- Exploit idea: `hexdigest` over a differently-encoded string yields a different digest for the same logical content
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `validate` returns false for an empty-string hmac and for a wrong-length digest
