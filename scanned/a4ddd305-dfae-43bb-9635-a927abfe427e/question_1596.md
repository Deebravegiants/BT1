# Q1596: get-asset-value via collateral-remove: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) reach `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-remove` in simnet and assert `get-asset-value` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
