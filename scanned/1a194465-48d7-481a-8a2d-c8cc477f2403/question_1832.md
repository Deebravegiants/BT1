# Q1832: migrate_to_expiring_token — client_secret sent to a derived host via requested token type

## Question
Trace `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` from `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)` with the `requested_token_type:` argument, selecting an online or offline token for the same subject token: because the POST body carries `client_id` and `client_secret` to `https://#{dest_shop}/admin/oauth/access_token`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Entrypoint: `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`
- Attacker controls: the `requested_token_type:` argument, selecting an online or offline token for the same subject token
- Exploit idea: the POST body carries `client_id` and `client_secret` to `https://#{dest_shop}/admin/oauth/access_token`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
