# Q2418: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — validated value discarded via embedded port

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string carrying an explicit port such as `victim.myshopify.com:8443` or `myshopify.com:80@evil.example` to `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment, does `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a shop string carrying an explicit port such as `victim.myshopify.com:8443` or `myshopify.com:80@evil.example`
- Exploit idea: the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
