# Q1351: debt-preview via supply-collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`debt-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331) computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:331` -> `debt-preview`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `debt-preview` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and the FORWARD index. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `debt-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
