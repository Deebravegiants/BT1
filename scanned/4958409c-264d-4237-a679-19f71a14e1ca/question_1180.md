# Q1180: create via collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) reach `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
