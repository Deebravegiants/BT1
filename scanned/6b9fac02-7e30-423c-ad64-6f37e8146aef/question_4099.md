# Q4099: get — guard order via resource id injection

## Question
Can an id segment taken from user input, e.g. `orders/#{params[:id]}` where the id contains `/` or `?`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input, make `Clients::Rest::Admin#get` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#get`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input
- Attacker controls: an id segment taken from user input, e.g. `orders/#{params[:id]}` where the id contains `/` or `?`
- Exploit idea: the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
