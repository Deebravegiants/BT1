# Q177: index external key rebinding via keychainRpc

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `keychainRpc` in `sdks/headless/src/features/keychain-rpc/index.js` through connected website RPC request that reaches key-management methods through the wallet bridge and supply crafted `port`, `port`, and `port` values that widen a derivation or export scope so a narrower approved request yields broader key material, violating the invariant that locked state must prevent all operations that derive, export, decrypt, or sign with key material, and causing `Sitewide disruption of core services`?

## Target
- File/function: sdks/headless/src/features/keychain-rpc/index.js::keychainRpc
- Entrypoint: connected website RPC request that reaches key-management methods through the wallet bridge
- Attacker controls: the order of lock/unlock, export, and sign requests around cached decrypted state
- Exploit idea: widen a derivation or export scope so a narrower approved request yields broader key material
- Invariant to test: locked state must prevent all operations that derive, export, decrypt, or sign with key material
- Expected Immunefi impact: Sitewide disruption of core services
- Fast validation: lock and clear between repeated export/sign operations and verify no cached key material remains usable
