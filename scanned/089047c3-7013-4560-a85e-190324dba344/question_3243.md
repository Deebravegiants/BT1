# Q3243: to_versioned_transaction settles one authorization twice (transaction_view.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair reach `to_versioned_transaction` in `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/transaction_view.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and have `to_versioned_transaction` apply the same authorized effect a second time, so that the invariant "One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime-transaction/src/runtime_transaction/transaction_view.rs` -> `to_versioned_transaction()` (around line 204)
- Entrypoint: a transaction broadcast to a public TPU/QUIC endpoint by an ordinary funded keypair
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Get `to_versioned_transaction` to apply the same logical effect twice from a single user authorization by re-entering it or replaying the surrounding flow.
- Invariant to test: One signed authorization produces exactly one state effect.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Integration test: submit the flow twice (and once re-entrantly) and assert the second application is rejected and balances moved once.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can replay or double-apply one signed transaction through durable-nonce advance, blockhash-queue aging, or status-cache dedup so a single authorization settles more than once.
