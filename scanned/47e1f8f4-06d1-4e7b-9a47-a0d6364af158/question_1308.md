# Q1308: from — copy preserves the key via shop with separator

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair at `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`, makes `Auth::Session.from` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.from`
- Entrypoint: `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`
- Attacker controls: a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair
- Exploit idea: `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
