# Q4181: send-tokens via transfer: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752), controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, drive `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) — which pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal — to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `transfer` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `transfer` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
