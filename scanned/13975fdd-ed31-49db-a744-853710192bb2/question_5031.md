# Q5031: shopify_user_id — no iss/dest binding via iss/dest mismatch

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id` from `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?` with a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares: because the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shopify_user_id`
- Entrypoint: `shopify_user_id`, gated by `user_id_sub?` and `admin_session_token?`
- Attacker controls: a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares
- Exploit idea: the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
