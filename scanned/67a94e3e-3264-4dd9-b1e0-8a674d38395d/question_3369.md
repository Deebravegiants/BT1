# Q3369: convert-to-assets-preview via deposit: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `min-out`, drive `convert-to-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317) — which prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview` — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:317` -> `convert-to-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `convert-to-assets-preview` prices a redemption against `total-assets-preview` and `total-supply-preview`. Reach it through `deposit` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `convert-to-assets-preview` touches, run `deposit` with `min-out`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
