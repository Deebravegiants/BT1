# Q1431: cookie_session_id — caller decides identity shape via cookie plus token

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops to `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key, does `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops
- Exploit idea: the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
