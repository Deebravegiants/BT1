# Q4214: offline_session_id — no shop cross-check via cookie plus token

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` through `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation while supplying a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops, so that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
