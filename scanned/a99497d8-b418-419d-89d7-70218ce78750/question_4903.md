# Q4903: base_find — method shadowing via original_state diff

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends to `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`, does `Rest::Base.base_find` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.base_find`
- Entrypoint: `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`
- Attacker controls: the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
