# Q600: migrate_to_expiring_token — no consumption tracking via dest-controlled host

## Question
Trace `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` from `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)` with the `dest` claim, which becomes `dest_shop` and then `Session.new(shop: dest_shop)` and then the request host, with no `ShopValidator` call: because a subject token can be exchanged repeatedly within its validity window, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token`
- Entrypoint: `migrate_to_expiring_token(shop:, non_expiring_offline_token:)`
- Attacker controls: the `dest` claim, which becomes `dest_shop` and then `Session.new(shop: dest_shop)` and then the request host, with no `ShopValidator` call
- Exploit idea: a subject token can be exchanged repeatedly within its validity window
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: mint a token whose `dest` is a non-Shopify host, call `exchange_token`, and assert no request carrying `client_secret` left for that host
