# Q2806: initialize — token attached before destination is settled via deprecation header

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim at `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`, makes `Clients::HttpClient#initialize` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`
- Attacker controls: an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim
- Exploit idea: `X-Shopify-Access-Token` is added in the constructor, before any per-request check of where the URL will resolve
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
