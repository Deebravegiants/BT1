# Q276: store_scopes — parsing is lossy via unauthenticated_ prefix

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `unauthenticated_write_*` scope, which manufactures `unauthenticated_read_*` to the private `store_scopes`, which builds `compressed_scopes` and `expanded_scopes`, does `Auth::AuthScopes#store_scopes` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because splitting and stripping can merge or drop entries so the parsed set differs from the granted grant? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#store_scopes`
- Entrypoint: the private `store_scopes`, which builds `compressed_scopes` and `expanded_scopes`
- Attacker controls: an `unauthenticated_write_*` scope, which manufactures `unauthenticated_read_*`
- Exploit idea: splitting and stripping can merge or drop entries so the parsed set differs from the granted grant
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: assert `covers?` is false for any scope name outside a known Shopify scope vocabulary
