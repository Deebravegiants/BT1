# Q797: exchange_token — validated argument ignored via attacker id token

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a session token the attacker legitimately holds for their own shop, since one `api_secret_key` validates tokens for every install at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token, makes `TokenExchange.exchange_token` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `shop:` argument the caller validated is discarded, so the value validated and the value used differ? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.exchange_token`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token
- Attacker controls: a session token the attacker legitimately holds for their own shop, since one `api_secret_key` validates tokens for every install
- Exploit idea: the `shop:` argument the caller validated is discarded, so the value validated and the value used differ
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
