# Q5126: admin_session_token? — claim trusted as identity via aud edge

## Question
Does `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key) at `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check? Show that a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key)
- Exploit idea: a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
