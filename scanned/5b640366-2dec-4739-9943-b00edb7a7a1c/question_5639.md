# Q5639: to_signable_string — shop handed to handler unverified via base64 padding variants

## Question
Can an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else, make `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else
- Attacker controls: an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
