# Q5471: mask-to-list-collateral via borrow: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `borrow` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `price-feeds` buffers, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
