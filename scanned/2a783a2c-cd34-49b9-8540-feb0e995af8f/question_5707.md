# Q5707: merge-price via liquidate-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`merge-price` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506) attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:506` -> `merge-price`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `merge-price` attaches a price to an asset record by position in the fold, not by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, then read `merge-price` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
