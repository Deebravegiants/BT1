# Q1272: temp — id and shop can disagree via caller-supplied id

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session.temp` from `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block with the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key: because `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.temp`
- Entrypoint: `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block
- Attacker controls: the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key
- Exploit idea: `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
