# Q1563: cache cross-account signing via getCacheKey

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `getCacheKey` in `features/cached-sodium-encryptor/module/cache.ts` through signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action and supply crafted `seedId`, `derivationPath`, and `port` values that reuse cached decrypted material or exported key state across a lock, clear, or account boundary, violating the invariant that derivation scope must never expand beyond the exact approved path or account context, and causing `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/cached-sodium-encryptor/module/cache.ts::getCacheKey
- Entrypoint: signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action
- Attacker controls: the requested wallet account, derivation path, key identifier, and signing payload bytes
- Exploit idea: reuse cached decrypted material or exported key state across a lock, clear, or account boundary
- Invariant to test: derivation scope must never expand beyond the exact approved path or account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: fuzz derivation-path and key-identifier inputs and assert the returned key scope never exceeds the approved request
