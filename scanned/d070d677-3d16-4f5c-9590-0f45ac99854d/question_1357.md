# Q1357: callback_address — re-register decision from response via regex metacharacters in host

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `Context.host_name` containing regex metacharacters, since it is interpolated into a pattern unescaped at `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`, makes `Registrations::Http#callback_address` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that whether the callback address is overwritten is decided by comparing against attacker-influenceable response content? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: a `Context.host_name` containing regex metacharacters, since it is interpolated into a pattern unescaped
- Exploit idea: whether the callback address is overwritten is decided by comparing against attacker-influenceable response content
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `callback_address` never returns a host outside the app's own origin
