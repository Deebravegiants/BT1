# Q4997: request — attacker-steered retry loop via response-driven retry

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a 429 or 500 response with a chosen `retry-after` header, steering the retry loop at `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, makes `Clients::HttpClient#request` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a 429 or 500 response with a chosen `retry-after` header, steering the retry loop
- Exploit idea: response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
