# Q5602: system-repay via repay: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `system-repay` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`, so the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:902` -> `system-repay`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `system-repay` splits one payment with three different formulas for `principal-reduction`, `principal-repaid` and `interest-paid`. Reach it through `repay` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
