# Q875: auth_base_uri — private-app guard ordering via chosen state cookie

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Oauth.auth_base_uri` through the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator` while supplying the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely, so that `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely
- Exploit idea: `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the returned `SessionCookie#value` is never equal to `session.id` for an embedded app, and that the cookie is cleared
