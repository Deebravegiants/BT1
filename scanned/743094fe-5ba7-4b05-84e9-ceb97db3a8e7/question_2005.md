# Q2005: callback_address — GraphQL by interpolation via topic string

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted to `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`, does `Registrations::Http#callback_address` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because topic and argument strings are concatenated into the document rather than passed as variables? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: the `@topic` value interpolated into `build_check_query` unquoted
- Exploit idea: topic and argument strings are concatenated into the document rather than passed as variables
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `callback_address` never returns a host outside the app's own origin
