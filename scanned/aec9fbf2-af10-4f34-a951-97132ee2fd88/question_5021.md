# Q5021: initialize — claim trusted as identity via sid claim

## Question
Does `JwtPayload#initialize` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header? Show that a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app, that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity
- Exploit idea: a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
