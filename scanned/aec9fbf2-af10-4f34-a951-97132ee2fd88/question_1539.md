# Q1539: to_signable_string — no single-use via stale signed callback

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an old but validly signed callback, since `timestamp` is carried into the signature yet never compared to now at `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback, makes `AuthQuery#to_signable_string` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that nothing marks a signed callback as consumed? Test SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback
- Attacker controls: an old but validly signed callback, since `timestamp` is carried into the signature yet never compared to now
- Exploit idea: nothing marks a signed callback as consumed
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: build the query two ways, assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both, and diff the two `to_signable_string` outputs
