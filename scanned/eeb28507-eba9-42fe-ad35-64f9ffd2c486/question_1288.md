# Q1288: unregister — verification result not carried via unsigned topic header

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Registry.unregister` through `Registry.unregister(topic:, session:)`, which interpolates a `webhook_id` into a delete mutation while supplying the topic, taken from an unsigned header, used both to select the handler and to build GraphQL documents, so that `process` proves the body was signed, then passes headers the signature never covered into the handler, breaking the requirement that SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`, and ending in Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.unregister`
- Entrypoint: `Registry.unregister(topic:, session:)`, which interpolates a `webhook_id` into a delete mutation
- Attacker controls: the topic, taken from an unsigned header, used both to select the handler and to build GraphQL documents
- Exploit idea: `process` proves the body was signed, then passes headers the signature never covered into the handler
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: register two handlers, submit one signed body with each topic header, and assert dispatch follows the signature rather than the header
