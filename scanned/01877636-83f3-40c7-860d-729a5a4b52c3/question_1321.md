# Q1321: calc-treasury-lp-preview via liquidate-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), controlling the redemption receiver, drive `calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) — which divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, then read `calc-treasury-lp-preview` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
