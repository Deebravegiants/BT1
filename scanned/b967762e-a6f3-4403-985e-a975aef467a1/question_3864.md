# Q3864: relevant via collateral-remove-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-underlying` reach `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-underlying`
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-underlying` across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `relevant` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
