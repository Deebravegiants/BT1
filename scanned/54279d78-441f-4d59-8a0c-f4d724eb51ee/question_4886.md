# Q4886: decode_token — leeway on both ends via dest without scheme

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#decode_token` through the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')` while supplying a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip), so that a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` claim that is not `https://<shop>` (no scheme, a path, a port, or multiple `https://` occurrences the unanchored `gsub` all strip)
- Exploit idea: a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
