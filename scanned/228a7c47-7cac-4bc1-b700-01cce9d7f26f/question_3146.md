# Q3146: offline_session_id — key is predictable via guessed online key

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint to `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation, does `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
