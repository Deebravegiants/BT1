# Q5009: ton_connect nonce via a pre-signed `MultiP storage_deposit

## Question
For standard `ton_connect` (`prepareSwapSignedData` case `TON_CONNECT`; `address`, `domain`, `timestamp`, `payload.text`, `public_key` derived from `userAddress`), can an unprivileged caller alter `nonce` (the 32-byte replay guard (versioned salted nonce)) via a pre-signed `MultiPayload` passed in `signedIntents.before` / `.after`, given composed payloads are published atomically without inspection, so that a `storage_deposit` intent (`contract_id` = omni.bridge.near, `deposit_for_account_id`, `amount` = nativeFee) is signed and published under a `nonce` the SDK user did not intend, and intents.near accepts it because the signature still verifies over the altered payload?

## Target
- File/function: packages/intents-sdk/src/intents/intent-executer-impl/intent-executer.ts `signAndSendIntent`, `mergeIntentPayloads`, `composeMultiPayloads`; intent-payload-builder.ts; intent-payload-factory.ts; intent-signer-impl/*
- Entrypoint: `IntentsSDK.signAndSendIntent` / `intentBuilder()` / `sendSignedIntents`
- Attacker controls: `nonce` through via a pre-signed `MultiPayload` passed in `signedIntents.before` / `.after`; the `storage_deposit` intent body
- Exploit idea: composed payloads are published atomically without inspection. For `ton_connect` the signed bytes are `computeTonConnectHash` (0xffff || 'ton-connect/sign-data/' || wc || addr || domain_len || domain || ts || 'txt' || len || text).
- Invariant to test: signed.nonce == the value the caller constructed; for `intents`, the multiset of intents signed equals the multiset added (no reference-dedup collapse, no reorder).
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - signature bound to the wrong contract, signer or nonce (HackenProof: intent signing and verification, nonce management)
- Fast validation: vitest: use a `ton_connect` signer with a recording `signMessage`, apply the manipulation, decode the signed payload and diff every field.
