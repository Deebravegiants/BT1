# Q4028: calc-index-next via repay: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list reach `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it applies a multiplier to the current index, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `repay` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with whether the repaid asset is in the accrued debt list varied, and assert that the value `calc-index-next` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
