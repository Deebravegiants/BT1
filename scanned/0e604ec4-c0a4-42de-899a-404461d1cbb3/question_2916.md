# Q2916: relevant via liquidate-multi: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) reach `relevant` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask, the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:175` -> `relevant`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `relevant` drops any position row whose bit is not present in the enabled mask. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none) across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `relevant` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
