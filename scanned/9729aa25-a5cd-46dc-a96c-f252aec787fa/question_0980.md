# Q980: compute_signature — secret selected before value is bounded via length-varied digest

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `HmacValidator.compute_signature` through `compute_signature`, an `OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest` over `to_signable_string` with `Context.api_secret_key` while supplying a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling, so that which secret verifies is decided by the result of the first comparison, an attacker-observable oracle, breaking the requirement that SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`, and ending in Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/hmac_validator.rb` -> `HmacValidator.compute_signature`
- Entrypoint: `compute_signature`, an `OpenSSL::HMAC.hexdigest` over `to_signable_string` with `Context.api_secret_key`
- Attacker controls: a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling
- Exploit idea: which secret verifies is decided by the result of the first comparison, an attacker-observable oracle
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: sign a body as UTF-8, re-present it as ASCII-8BIT, and assert the verification verdict is unchanged
