# Q1389: get-bitmap via collateral-remove: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), drive `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) — which returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-bitmap` touches, run `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
