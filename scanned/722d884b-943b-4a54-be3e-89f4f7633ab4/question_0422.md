# Q422: rpc manager fail-open bridge parsing via handles

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge and control `params`, `port`, and `name` so that `handles` in `libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/rpc-manager.js` carry pre-approval, unlocked, or imported-seed state across a boundary that should reset it, breaking the invariant that malformed RPC payloads must fail closed and never select state-changing defaults, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/rpc-manager.js::handles
- Entrypoint: connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge
- Attacker controls: a metadata-bearing request plus disconnect/reconnect timing from the same browser session
- Exploit idea: carry pre-approval, unlocked, or imported-seed state across a boundary that should reset it
- Invariant to test: malformed RPC payloads must fail closed and never select state-changing defaults
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: fuzz malformed RPC payloads and verify the bridge rejects them before any wallet-mutating method is reached
