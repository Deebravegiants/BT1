# Q4380: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `collateral-receiver` reach `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `collateral-receiver` across its boundary values through `liquidate` in simnet and assert `calc-liquidation-params` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
