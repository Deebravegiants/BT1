# Q0391: root_bank is not deterministic across nodes (bank_forks.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `root_bank` in `runtime/src/bank_forks.rs` with an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash, and make the status cache entry deduping a signature disagree with the signatures actually committed in that slot, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `root_bank` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/bank_forks.rs` -> `root_bank()` (around line 287)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an input whose length field is not committed to by the hash
- Exploit idea: Find input to `root_bank` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `root_bank` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `root_bank` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can submit a transaction whose loading, sanitization, ALT resolution, or execution result differs between honest validators, causing bank-hash divergence, a fork, or an unbootable ledger replay.
