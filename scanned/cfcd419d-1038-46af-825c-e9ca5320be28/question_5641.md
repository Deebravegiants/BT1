# Q5641: unified_admin? — nil-safe guard skipped via dotless name

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input at the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`, makes `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
