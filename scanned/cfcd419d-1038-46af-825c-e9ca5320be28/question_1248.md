# Q1248: exchange_token — error branch reveals verdict via error-path body

## Question
Does `TokenExchange.exchange_token` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a 400 response whose `error` field steers the `invalid_subject_token` branch at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token? Show that distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity, that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.exchange_token`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token
- Attacker controls: a 400 response whose `error` field steers the `invalid_subject_token` branch
- Exploit idea: distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: mint a token whose `dest` is a non-Shopify host, call `exchange_token`, and assert no request carrying `client_secret` left for that host
