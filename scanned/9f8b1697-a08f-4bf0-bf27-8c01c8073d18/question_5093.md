# Q5093: trigger: consensus hash divergence

## Question
In `runtime/src/installed_scheduler_pool.rs`, can an unprivileged attacker who can submit a transaction / block whose replay hits this path attacker input make `trigger` (near line 88) produce a slot-dependent or nondeterministic result so two honest validators diverge in bank/account hash, breaking the invariant that all honest validators derive identical bank/account hashes and results for a block, corrupting the resulting bank hash / account hash / transaction result recorded for the slot?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/installed_scheduler_pool.rs` :: `trigger` (around line 88)
- Entrypoint: Transaction / instruction execution inside the bank — attacker can submit a transaction / block whose replay hits this path
- Attacker controls: instruction data, account set, nonce, fee payer, and program invocations
- Exploit idea: Can attacker input make `trigger` (near line 88) produce a slot-dependent or nondeterministic result so two honest validators diverge in bank/account hash, so that the resulting bank hash / account hash / transaction result recorded for the slot is set to an attacker-chosen or inconsistent value.
- Invariant to test: all honest validators derive identical bank/account hashes and results for a block
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical. Two honest validators processing the same block can reach different bank hashes, account hashes, fee/compute-unit accounting, or transaction results, producing a fork or stalled rooting that no honest node can resolve.
- Fast validation: add a focused Rust unit/fuzz test on `trigger` in `runtime/src/installed_scheduler_pool.rs` asserting identical output under reordered/slot-varied inputs.
