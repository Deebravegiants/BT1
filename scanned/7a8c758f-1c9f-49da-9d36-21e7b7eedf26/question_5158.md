# Q5158: set_property — path interpolation from ids via read-only attribute

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update` at `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, makes `Rest::Base#set_property` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update`
- Exploit idea: ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
