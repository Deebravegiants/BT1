# Q55: to_signable_string — coverage gap via stale signed callback

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an old but validly signed callback, since `timestamp` is carried into the signature yet never compared to now at `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback, makes `AuthQuery#to_signable_string` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that a field the host app or gem acts on is outside `to_signable_string`, so a valid HMAC vouches for less than the app assumes? Test BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback
- Attacker controls: an old but validly signed callback, since `timestamp` is carried into the signature yet never compared to now
- Exploit idea: a field the host app or gem acts on is outside `to_signable_string`, so a valid HMAC vouches for less than the app assumes
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: sign a canonical query with the test secret, mutate an out-of-coverage field, and assert `validate` still returns true
