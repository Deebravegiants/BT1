# Q5833: unified_admin? — dev-domain entries reachable in production via dotless name

## Question
Does `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input at the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`? Show that `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties, that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input
- Exploit idea: `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
