# Q3713: log_progress charges far less than it costs (snapshot_storage_rebuilder.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `log_progress` in `runtime/src/snapshot_utils/snapshot_storage_rebuilder.rs` with arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied, and make the real CPU/memory cost of `log_progress` exceed the units charged for it, so that the invariant "Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `runtime/src/snapshot_utils/snapshot_storage_rebuilder.rs` -> `log_progress()` (around line 77)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: arguments that drive the path into its error branch after side effects were applied
- Exploit idea: Find the input shape where `log_progress`'s real CPU/memory/IO cost grows much faster than the compute units or fee charged for it.
- Invariant to test: Charged cost is a monotone upper bound on real cost for every input shape.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Measure real time/allocations versus units charged across input sizes; assert cost/CU ratio stays bounded.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can make compute-budget, cost-model, or fee accounting charge materially less than the real CPU, memory, or account-load work performed, exhausting block capacity or node resources below true cost.
