# Q2010: validate_auth_callback — shop reaches HttpClient unvalidated via cross-shop state reuse

## Question
Starting from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `state` nonce obtained from the attacker's own `begin_auth` call and presented with a callback naming a different `shop` so that `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`, and whether the result reaches Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: a `state` nonce obtained from the attacker's own `begin_auth` call and presented with a callback naming a different `shop`
- Exploit idea: `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
