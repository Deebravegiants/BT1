# Q3410: principal-ratio-reduction via collateral-remove-redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling `receiver` for the underlying leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, so the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury would fail, yielding permanent freezing of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver` for the underlying leg
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - permanent freezing of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `receiver` for the underlying leg varied, and assert that the value `principal-ratio-reduction` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
