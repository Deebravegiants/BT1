# Q0058: add-user-collateral via liquidate: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling `collateral-receiver`, can an unprivileged attacker make `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) mint shares whose backing was never received? `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `collateral-receiver`
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `liquidate` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with `collateral-receiver`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
