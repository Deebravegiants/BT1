# Q0628: next-liquidity-index via deposit: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `recipient`, including a contract principal reach `next-liquidity-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:392` -> `next-liquidity-index`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `next-liquidity-index` rounds the liquidity multiplier down while `next-index` rounds the debt multiplier up over the same interval. Reach it through `deposit` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
