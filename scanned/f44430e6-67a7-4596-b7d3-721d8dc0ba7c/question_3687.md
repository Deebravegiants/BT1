# Q3687: copy_attributes_from — equality omits the token via concurrent temp

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from` from `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id` with overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session: because `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from`
- Entrypoint: `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id`
- Attacker controls: overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session
- Exploit idea: `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
