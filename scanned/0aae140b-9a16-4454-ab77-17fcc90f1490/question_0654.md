# Q0654: collateral-remove via borrow: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) mint shares whose backing was never received? `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `borrow` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `collateral-remove` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
