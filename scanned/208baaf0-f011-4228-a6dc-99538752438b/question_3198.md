# Q3198: factory deployment: exploit appendBytecodeChunk/resetBytecod [when the token silently return]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker exploit appendBytecodeChunk/resetBytecodeChunks ordering so deployHinkal deploys mismatched bytecode passing the hash, to hijack the deterministic Hinkal address, deploy attacker bytecode at it, or permanently block the intended deployment, specifically when the token silently returns false on failure (where SafeERC20 and the balance delta can disagree)?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/HinkalFactory.sol :: deployHinkal / appendBytecodeChunk / HinkalFactoryDeployer
- Entrypoint: HinkalFactoryDeployer constructor / HinkalFactory (pre-ownership)
- Attacker controls: create2 salt via SAFE_SINGLETON_FACTORY, deployment ordering (only if reachable pre-owner)
- Exploit idea: race or corrupt the deterministic deployment before ownership is settled
- Invariant to test: the code at the deterministic Hinkal address == the audited Hinkal bytecode
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: permanent freezing of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry: simulate the create2 race/hash mismatch, assert wrong code or blocked deploy
