# Q5014: sanitize! — path segment trusted as identity via trailing-dot host

## Question
Does `ShopValidator.sanitize!` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ at `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`? Show that the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Entrypoint: `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: a shop string with a fully-qualified trailing dot such as `victim.myshopify.com.` so that the parsed `domain` and the host an HTTP client actually resolves differ
- Exploit idea: the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
