# Q220: proxy_query — caller document executed verbatim via session supplied by the route

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `session:` argument, if the host app resolves it from a cookie or id token the attacker influences to `ShopifyAPI::Utils::GraphqlProxy.proxy_query(session:, headers:, body:, cookies:, tries:)`, wired by apps to a browser-reachable proxy route, does `GraphqlProxy.proxy_query` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the document reaches `Clients::Graphql::Admin#query` unchanged, with the merchant's access token attached? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/graphql_proxy.rb` -> `GraphqlProxy.proxy_query`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::GraphqlProxy.proxy_query(session:, headers:, body:, cookies:, tries:)`, wired by apps to a browser-reachable proxy route
- Attacker controls: the `session:` argument, if the host app resolves it from a cookie or id token the attacker influences
- Exploit idea: the document reaches `Clients::Graphql::Admin#query` unchanged, with the merchant's access token attached
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `proxy_query` rejects a document the session's `scope` does not cover
