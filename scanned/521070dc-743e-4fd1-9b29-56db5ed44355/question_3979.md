# Q3979: auth_base_uri — no replay window via extra query parameters

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits additional query keys outside the five that `to_signable_string` covers (`code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp`) to the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`, does `Oauth.auth_base_uri` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: additional query keys outside the five that `to_signable_string` covers (`code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp`)
- Exploit idea: nothing records that a `state` was consumed, so a signed callback can be submitted repeatedly
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the returned `SessionCookie#value` is never equal to `session.id` for an embedded app, and that the cookie is cleared
