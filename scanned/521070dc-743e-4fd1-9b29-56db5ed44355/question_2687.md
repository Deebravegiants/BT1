# Q2687: make_request — guard order via query hash injection

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `query:` hash whose keys or values are user-controlled and are serialised by HTTParty into the outgoing query at the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`, makes `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: a `query:` hash whose keys or values are user-controlled and are serialised by HTTParty into the outgoing query
- Exploit idea: the `rest_disabled` and version-log branches run before the value that decides the URL is bounded
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a user-supplied resource id containing `/`, `?` or `#` cannot change the recorded request path beyond one segment
