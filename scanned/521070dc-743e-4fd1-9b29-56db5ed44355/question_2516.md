# Q2516: post — path built by interpolation via body-type coupling

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a nil body with a method that requires one, or a body supplied for a `:get`, probing `HttpRequest#verify` to `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token, does `Clients::Rest::Admin#post` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#post`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#post(path:, body:, ...)`, whose `body` is JSON-serialised and sent with the merchant's access token
- Attacker controls: a nil body with a method that requires one, or a body supplied for a `:get`, probing `HttpRequest#verify`
- Exploit idea: resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a user-supplied resource id containing `/`, `?` or `#` cannot change the recorded request path beyond one segment
