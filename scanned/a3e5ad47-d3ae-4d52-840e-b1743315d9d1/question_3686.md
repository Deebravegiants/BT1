# Q3686: process-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, can an unprivileged attacker make `process-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`, so the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:761` -> `process-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `process-debt-asset` caps debt at the max liquidatable USD and converts back to tokens with `mul-div-down`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed varied, and assert that the value `process-debt-asset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
