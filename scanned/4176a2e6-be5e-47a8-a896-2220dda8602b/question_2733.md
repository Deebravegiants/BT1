# Q2733: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — unauthenticated bytes become the key via Bearer interior match

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded to `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims, does `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded
- Exploit idea: the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
