# Q0737: accrue-user-debts via supply-collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) — which folds accrual over the position's debt list only — to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
