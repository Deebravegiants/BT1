# Q2173: get-full-position via borrow: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `get-full-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470) — which returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:470` -> `get-full-position`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-full-position` returns all collateral rows regardless of the enabled bitmap. Reach it through `borrow` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `get-full-position` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
