# Q799: get — caller headers win via traversal to another version

## Question
Starting from `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input, can an unprivileged attacker supply `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure so that `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `Clients::Rest::Admin#get`, and whether the result reaches High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#get`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin#get(path:, body:, query:, headers:, tries:)` as called by host-app routes that derive `path` or `query` from request input
- Attacker controls: `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
