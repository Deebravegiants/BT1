# Q4861: calc-multiplier-delta via liquidate: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, drive `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) — which compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag — to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `liquidate` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, then read `calc-multiplier-delta` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
