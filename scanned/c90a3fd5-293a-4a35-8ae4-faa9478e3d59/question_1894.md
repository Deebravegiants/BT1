# Q1894: key state public_key mixed request classes bypass

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `public_key` and use the chosen predecessor override, derivation path, queried domain or curve, and timing relative to key-version changes to drive the code path through `crates/contract/src/primitives/key_state.rs::public_key` so that mixed request classes bypass the intended validation or return path, breaking the invariant that request-kind separation must hold across storage, callback wiring, and response resolution, and leading to Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability?

## Target
- File/function: crates/contract/src/primitives/key_state.rs:47::public_key
- Entrypoint: `public_key`
- Attacker controls: the chosen predecessor override, derivation path, queried domain or curve, and timing relative to key-version changes
- Exploit idea: mixed request classes bypass the intended validation or return path
- Invariant to test: request-kind separation must hold across storage, callback wiring, and response resolution
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized access to MPC key shares or signing capability
- Fast validation: enqueue different request kinds with colliding timing or similar serialized bodies and see whether the wrong resolver accepts the completion
