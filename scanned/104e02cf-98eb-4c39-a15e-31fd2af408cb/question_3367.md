# Q3367: remote config feature flags cache-validator skip via factory

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `port`, `config`, or stale-state timing so that `factory` in `features/feature-flags/atoms/remote-config-feature-flags.js` apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context, violating the invariant that security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state, and leading to `Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction`?

## Target
- File/function: features/feature-flags/atoms/remote-config-feature-flags.js::factory
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: an older-but-well-formed config blob that survives wallet restart or restore
- Exploit idea: apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context
- Invariant to test: security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction
- Fast validation: unit-test ETag / Last-Modified transitions and verify a required refresh is not skipped when effective policy changed
