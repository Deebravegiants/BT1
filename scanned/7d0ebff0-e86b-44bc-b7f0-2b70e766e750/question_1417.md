# Q1417: request — dev-mode rewrite in production via session.shop

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator` to `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, does `Clients::HttpClient#request` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
