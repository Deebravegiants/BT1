# Q3719: begin_auth — cookie value becomes the session id via chosen state cookie

## Question
Does `Oauth.begin_auth` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`? Show that in the non-embedded branch the returned cookie's value is `session.id`, publishing the storage key to the browser, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely
- Exploit idea: in the non-embedded branch the returned cookie's value is `session.id`, publishing the storage key to the browser
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the returned `SessionCookie#value` is never equal to `session.id` for an embedded app, and that the cookie is cleared
