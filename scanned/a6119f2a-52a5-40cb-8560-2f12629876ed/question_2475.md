# Q2475: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — key is predictable via omitted id token

## Question
Can an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims, make `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: an embedded request that simply omits the `Authorization` header, taking the cookie fallback branch
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
