# Q3430: Owner-fee bypass via withdraw_all under victim pair unlock boundary full position edge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker time `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all()` with the key step is attempted exactly at the four-epoch unlock boundary after prior unstaking and near-full-position amounts that leave, consume, or depend on a one-yocto residual balance/share edge so reward settlement occurs while the attacker is in or out of the pool at precisely the profitable moment, effectively bypassing the intended owner fee or making other stakers absorb a larger fee share than the attacker's capital should bear?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_withdraw` and `internal_ping` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping` and owner-fee share minting in `reward_fee_fraction.multiply(total_reward)`
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all()`
- Attacker controls: full unstaked balance, epoch height, intervening `ping()` calls, and whether dust or extra liquid value remains after full withdrawal; one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked; the key step is attempted exactly at the four-epoch unlock boundary after prior unstaking; near-full-position amounts that leave, consume, or depend on a one-yocto residual balance/share edge
- Exploit idea: Test whether the public call order around `internal_ping()` lets the attacker enter after fee dilution but exit before bearing the matching fee-adjusted economics.
- Invariant to test: Owner fee should be collected proportionally from the rewarded stake base, and public settlement timing must not let one user offload that fee burden onto others.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Fee payment bypass
- Fast validation: Run paired simulations with the same reward and stake set, varying only whether `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all()` happens before or after `ping()`; compare attacker net value and owner fee collected.
