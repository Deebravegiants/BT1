# Q5364: price-multi-resolve via collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) reach `price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch)
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz whether this asset is already collateral (the is-new-collateral branch) across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `price-multi-resolve` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
