# Q3709: validate_auth_callback — session id derived from callback input via empty state

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an empty-string `state` in both cookie and query, so the `state == auth_query.state` comparison trivially succeeds at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, makes `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: an empty-string `state` in both cookie and query, so the `state == auth_query.state` comparison trivially succeeds
- Exploit idea: `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
