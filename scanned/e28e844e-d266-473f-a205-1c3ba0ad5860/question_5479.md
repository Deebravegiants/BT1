# Q5479: shopify_header — shop handed to handler unverified via base64url vs standard

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header` from the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>` with a base64url-encoded digest (`-`/`_`) that `decode64` reinterprets: because `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header`
- Entrypoint: the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`
- Attacker controls: a base64url-encoded digest (`-`/`_`) that `decode64` reinterprets
- Exploit idea: `WebhookMetadata#shop` is the raw header value and is what the host app uses to decide whose records to touch
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
