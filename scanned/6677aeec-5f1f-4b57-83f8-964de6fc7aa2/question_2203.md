# Q2203: setup — global identity, per-request requests via api_host vs session.shop

## Question
Trace `Context.setup` from `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope` with the `api_host` setting, which splits the connection host from the `Host` header taken from `session.shop`: because one process-wide `Context` serves every shop, so any leakage between requests crosses a tenant boundary, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.setup`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`
- Attacker controls: the `api_host` setting, which splits the connection host from the `Host` header taken from `session.shop`
- Exploit idea: one process-wide `Context` serves every shop, so any leakage between requests crosses a tenant boundary
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `activate_session` is cleared at the end of a request cycle so a pooled thread cannot serve a stale tenant
