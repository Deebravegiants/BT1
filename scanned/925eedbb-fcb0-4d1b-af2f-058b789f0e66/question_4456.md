# Q4456: offline_session_id — caller decides identity shape via chosen cookie value

## Question
Can the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation, make `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check
- Exploit idea: the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
