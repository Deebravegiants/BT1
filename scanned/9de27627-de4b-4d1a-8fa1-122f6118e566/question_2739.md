# Q2739: find-collateral-amount via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the future mask produced by the new debt bit, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the future mask produced by the new debt bit
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-collateral-amount` touches, run `borrow` with the future mask produced by the new debt bit, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
