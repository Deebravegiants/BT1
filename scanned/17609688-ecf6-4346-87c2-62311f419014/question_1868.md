# Q1868: accrue-user-collateral via redeem: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption reach `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `redeem` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption varied, and assert that the value `accrue-user-collateral` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
