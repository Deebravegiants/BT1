# Q3188: get-asset-value via collateral-remove-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `get-asset-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:679` -> `get-asset-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `get-asset-value` resolves a fresh price for a single asset and normalizes with a caller-supplied rounding direction. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `get-asset-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
