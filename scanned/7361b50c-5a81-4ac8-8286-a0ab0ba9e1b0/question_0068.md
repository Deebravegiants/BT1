# Q0068: refresh via collateral-remove: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with `receiver`, including a contract principal varied, and assert that the value `refresh` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
