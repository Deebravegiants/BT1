# Q1095: total-assets-preview via liquidate-redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`total-assets-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341) re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the borrower targeted, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:341` -> `total-assets-preview`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the borrower targeted
- Exploit idea: `total-assets-preview` re-derives a FORWARD index inside calls that have already accrued. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `total-assets-preview` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the borrower targeted, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
