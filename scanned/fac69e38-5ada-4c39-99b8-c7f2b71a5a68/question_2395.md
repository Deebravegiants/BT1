# Q2395: initialize — handler chosen by unsigned data via underscore/dash aliasing

## Question
Starting from `Request.new(raw_body:, headers:)`, called by the app's public webhook endpoint on every inbound POST, can an unprivileged attacker supply header names that collide after `downcase.sub("http_","").gsub("_","-")`, e.g. `HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_TOPIC` vs `X-Shopify-Topic` so that `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `Webhooks::Request#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Request.new(raw_body:, headers:)`, called by the app's public webhook endpoint on every inbound POST
- Attacker controls: header names that collide after `downcase.sub("http_","").gsub("_","-")`, e.g. `HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_TOPIC` vs `X-Shopify-Topic`
- Exploit idea: `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
