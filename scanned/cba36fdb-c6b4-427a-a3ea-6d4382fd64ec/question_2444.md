# Q2444: subset via collateral-remove-redeem: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption reach `subset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it tests bitmask containment, the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:100` -> `subset`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `subset` tests bitmask containment. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove-redeem` twice with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption varied, and assert that the value `subset` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
