# Q3308: begin_auth — state compared with == via private/embedded config

## Question
Can an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, make `Oauth.begin_auth` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `state == auth_query.state` is a plain string comparison of a value the attacker can also observe or set? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself
- Exploit idea: `state == auth_query.state` is a plain string comparison of a value the attacker can also observe or set
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `begin_auth(shop: 'a.myshopify.com')`, then `validate_auth_callback` with a validly signed query naming shop B, and assert the returned `session.shop`
