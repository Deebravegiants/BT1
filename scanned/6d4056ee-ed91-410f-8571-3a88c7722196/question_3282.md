# Q3282: feature flag atoms cache-validator skip via factory

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state with crafted `config`, `name`, or stale-state timing so that `factory` in `features/feature-flags/atoms/feature-flag-atoms.js` apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context, violating the invariant that security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state, and leading to `Sitewide disruption of core services`?

## Target
- File/function: features/feature-flags/atoms/feature-flag-atoms.js::factory
- Entrypoint: wallet startup / refresh path that consumes default-enabled configuration state
- Attacker controls: an older-but-well-formed config blob that survives wallet restart or restore
- Exploit idea: apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context
- Invariant to test: security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Sitewide disruption of core services
- Fast validation: fuzz config normalization with ambiguous booleans, arrays, and object merges and assert no privilege-widening output is produced
