# Q2056: add_transaction_error behaves inconsistently at a feature/epoch boundary (receive_and_buffer.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster reach `add_transaction_error` in `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/receive_and_buffer.rs` with an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure, and have `add_transaction_error` evaluated under one rule during banking and a different one during replay, so that the invariant "A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `core/src/banking_stage/transaction_scheduler/receive_and_buffer.rs` -> `add_transaction_error()` (around line 92)
- Entrypoint: a transaction that lands in a block and is replayed by every node on the cluster
- Attacker controls: an ordering of instructions that leaves partial state from an earlier failure
- Exploit idea: Land the transaction exactly on the slot where the gate flips so `add_transaction_error` is evaluated under one rule during scheduling and another during replay.
- Invariant to test: A transaction is evaluated under exactly one rule set, consistently across banking and replay.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Replay the same transaction against banks on both sides of the boundary and assert both nodes agree on accept/reject and result.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can submit a transaction whose loading, sanitization, ALT resolution, or execution result differs between honest validators, causing bank-hash divergence, a fork, or an unbootable ledger replay.
