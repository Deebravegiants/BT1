# Q3444: serialized_error — mutable shared header hash via scheme in path

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error` through `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers while supplying a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL, so that `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `https://` or an encoded scheme, turning the interpolation into an absolute URL
- Exploit idea: `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
