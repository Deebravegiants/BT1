# Q5071: calc-utilization via collateral-remove: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing the set of assets held, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `collateral-remove` with the set of assets held, then read `calc-utilization` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
