# Q0532: next-index via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `next-index` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:379` -> `next-index`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `next-index` returns the stale `index` unchanged when the accrue pause state is set, instead of reverting. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
