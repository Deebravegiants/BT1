# Q4481: initialize — temp restores unconditionally via concurrent temp

## Question
Starting from `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable, can an unprivileged attacker supply overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session so that the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `Auth::Session#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable
- Attacker controls: overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session
- Exploit idea: the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
