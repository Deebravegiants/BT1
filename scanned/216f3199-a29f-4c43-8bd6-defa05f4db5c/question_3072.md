# Q3072: base_find — cursor trusted via attribute shadowing a method

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state` at `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`, makes `Rest::Base.base_find` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.base_find`
- Entrypoint: `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`
- Attacker controls: a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state`
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
