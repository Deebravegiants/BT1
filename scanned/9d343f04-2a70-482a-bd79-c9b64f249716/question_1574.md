# Q1574: decode_token — rotation widens acceptance via leeway window

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf` at the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`, makes `JwtPayload#decode_token` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry? Test CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: a token replayed inside the 10-second `JWT_LEEWAY` on both `exp` and `nbf`
- Exploit idea: the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
