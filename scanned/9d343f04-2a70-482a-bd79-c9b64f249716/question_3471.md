# Q3471: host_name — host header decoupled from connection via api_host vs session.shop

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `api_host` setting, which splits the connection host from the `Host` header taken from `session.shop` at `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`, makes `Context.host_name` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that with `api_host` set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes elsewhere? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.host_name`
- Entrypoint: `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`
- Attacker controls: the `api_host` setting, which splits the connection host from the `Host` header taken from `session.shop`
- Exploit idea: with `api_host` set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes elsewhere
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: run two threads through `Session.temp` and assert neither observes the other's active session
