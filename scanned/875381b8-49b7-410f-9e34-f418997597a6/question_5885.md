# Q5885: parsed_body — handler chosen by unsigned data via duplicate JSON keys

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body` from `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification with a body containing a repeated JSON key, where the signed bytes and the `JSON.parse` result disagree about which value wins: because `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body`
- Entrypoint: `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification
- Attacker controls: a body containing a repeated JSON key, where the signed bytes and the `JSON.parse` result disagree about which value wins
- Exploit idea: `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
