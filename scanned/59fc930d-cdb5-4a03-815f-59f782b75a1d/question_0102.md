# Q102: setup — rotation window unbounded via rest_disabled

## Question
Can the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`, make `Context.setup` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that nothing ever clears `old_api_secret_key`? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.setup`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Context.setup(...)`, which stores every security-relevant global including `api_secret_key`, `old_api_secret_key`, `host`, `api_host` and `scope`
- Attacker controls: the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises
- Exploit idea: nothing ever clears `old_api_secret_key`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: run two threads through `Session.temp` and assert neither observes the other's active session
