# Q2287: host_name — host header decoupled from connection via scope default

## Question
Trace `Context.host_name` from `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI` with the default `scope`, used by `begin_auth` whenever no override is passed: because with `api_host` set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes elsewhere, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.host_name`
- Entrypoint: `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`
- Attacker controls: the default `scope`, used by `begin_auth` whenever no override is passed
- Exploit idea: with `api_host` set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes elsewhere
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `activate_session` is cleared at the end of a request cycle so a pooled thread cannot serve a stale tenant
