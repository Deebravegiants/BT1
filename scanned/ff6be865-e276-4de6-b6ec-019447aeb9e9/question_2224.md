# Q2224: decode_token — claim trusted as identity via aud edge

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#decode_token` from the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')` with an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key): because a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: an `aud` claim that equals `Context.api_key` by type coercion rather than value (array form, numeric key)
- Exploit idea: a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
