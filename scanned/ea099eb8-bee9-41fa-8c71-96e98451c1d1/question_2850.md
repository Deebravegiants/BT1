# Q2850: begin_auth — session id derived from callback input via chosen state cookie

## Question
Starting from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, can an unprivileged attacker supply the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely so that `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `Oauth.begin_auth`, and whether the result reaches Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie value, set by the attacker in the victim's browser or omitted entirely
- Exploit idea: `Session.from(shop: auth_query.shop, ...)` mints `offline_#{shop}` or `#{shop}_#{user.id}` from a value the attacker chose
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
