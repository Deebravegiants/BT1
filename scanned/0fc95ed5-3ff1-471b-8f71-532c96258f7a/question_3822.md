# Q3822: mask-pos via liquidate-multi: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the full batch list and its ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET, so the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `mask-pos` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
