# Q2431: unified_admin? — parse/resolve divergence via IDN / Unicode label

## Question
Does `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip` at the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`? Show that what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to, that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip`
- Exploit idea: what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
