# Q3112: Rounding extraction via withdraw_all under victim pair ping heavy full position edge

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all()` with one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked, a third party or attacker-owned helper repeatedly inserts public `ping()` calls between every economic step, and near-full-position amounts that leave, consume, or depend on a one-yocto residual balance/share edge to keep crossing the rounded-down mint path and the rounded-up exit path in different directions, so the attacker realizes more liquid NEAR than principal plus pro-rata rewards and effectively extracts value from the pool's rounding buffer?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_withdraw` and `internal_ping` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_stake`, `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::inner_unstake`, and the `num_shares_from_staked_amount_rounded_*` / `staked_amount_from_num_shares_rounded_*` helpers
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all()`
- Attacker controls: full unstaked balance, epoch height, intervening `ping()` calls, and whether dust or extra liquid value remains after full withdrawal; one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked; a third party or attacker-owned helper repeatedly inserts public `ping()` calls between every economic step; near-full-position amounts that leave, consume, or depend on a one-yocto residual balance/share edge
- Exploit idea: Drive a cycle through reach an unstaked balance through prior public calls, then use `withdraw_all()` as the full liquidation step so stake-share conversion pays rounded-down on entry but rounded-up on exit for the same economic position.
- Invariant to test: Across any public call sequence, attacker withdrawals plus remaining claimable balance must never exceed attacker principal plus fair rewards, and rounding must not create an externally extractable surplus.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Stealing or loss of funds
- Fast validation: Stateful test over `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::withdraw_all()` with one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked; sweep near-full-position amounts that leave, consume, or depend on a one-yocto residual balance/share edge across repeated entry/exit loops and assert non-positive attacker PnL net of legitimate rewards.
