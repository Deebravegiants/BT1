# Q947: memoized keychain external key rebinding via factory

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `factory` in `features/keychain/module/memoized-keychain.js` through signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action and supply crafted `port`, `publicKey`, and `xpub` values that widen a derivation or export scope so a narrower approved request yields broader key material, violating the invariant that locked state must prevent all operations that derive, export, decrypt, or sign with key material, and causing `Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/keychain/module/memoized-keychain.js::factory
- Entrypoint: signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action
- Attacker controls: the order of lock/unlock, export, and sign requests around cached decrypted state
- Exploit idea: widen a derivation or export scope so a narrower approved request yields broader key material
- Invariant to test: locked state must prevent all operations that derive, export, decrypt, or sign with key material
- Expected Immunefi impact: Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds
- Fast validation: construct a payload whose displayed fields and serialized bytes can diverge and assert the signer rejects or canonicalizes it safely
