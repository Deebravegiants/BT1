# Q2847: get_parsed_token_account grows memory without an enforced bound (parsed_token_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2 reach `get_parsed_token_account` in `rpc/src/parsed_token_accounts.rs` with a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length, and grow the buffer `get_parsed_token_account` feeds without any eviction bound taking effect, so that the invariant "Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy." breaks and the result is DoS?

## Target
- File/function: `rpc/src/parsed_token_accounts.rs` -> `get_parsed_token_account()` (around line 23)
- Entrypoint: one JSON-RPC call or websocket subscription from a single client, at most once per CLUSTER_SLOT_TIME_TARGET/2
- Attacker controls: a truncated or over-long encoding whose declared length disagrees with its real length
- Exploit idea: Repeatedly drive `get_parsed_token_account` so a buffer, map, or cache it feeds grows without eviction, exhausting node memory below the cost the attacker pays.
- Invariant to test: Every container this path writes into has an enforced capacity or eviction policy.
- Expected Immunefi impact: DoS - remote resource exhaustion via non-RPC protocols (315-1,250 SOL)
- Fast validation: Stress the path and assert the container's size plateaus rather than growing linearly with attacker input.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can make compute-budget, cost-model, or fee accounting charge materially less than the real CPU, memory, or account-load work performed, exhausting block capacity or node resources below true cost.
