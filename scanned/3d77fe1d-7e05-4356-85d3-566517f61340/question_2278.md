# Q2278: get-available-assets via transfer: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) while controlling the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-available-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:481` -> `get-available-assets`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `get-available-assets` reads real liquidity, a different quantity from the `assets` var that `redeem` also gates on. Reach it through `transfer` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
