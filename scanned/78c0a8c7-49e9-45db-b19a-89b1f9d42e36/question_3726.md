# Q3726: State-machine transition in stop_mirror skippable (brokers/orb.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker drive the Orb through a transition order that lets `stop_mirror` in [src/brokers/orb.rs](src/brokers/orb.rs) reach the enrollment/upload stage without the preceding authorization stage (identity scan, consent, or fraud verdict) having actually succeeded?

## Target
- File/function: [src/brokers/orb.rs](src/brokers/orb.rs) -> `stop_mirror` (function)
- Entrypoint: Physically driving the signup flow out of the intended order
- Attacker controls: timing of presence, absence, and re-presentation at each stage boundary
- Exploit idea: Find a transition in `stop_mirror` guarded by a flag rather than by possession of the prior stage's typed result.
- Invariant to test: Each stage consumes the typed output of its predecessor; no stage is reachable via a boolean/None-tolerant path.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Signup completed without the required authorization stage
- Fast validation: Model/state test enumerating transitions of `stop_mirror` and asserting unreachable stage-skip edges.
