# Q5680: trusted_domains — validator returns a non-Shopify host via userinfo bypass

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped to `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only, does `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: stub_request on the attacker host, call the flow, and `assert_not_requested` any host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
