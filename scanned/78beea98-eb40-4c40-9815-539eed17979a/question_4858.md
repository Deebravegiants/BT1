# Q4858: base_find — dynamic dispatch on response data via session argument

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Rest::Base.base_find` through `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params` while supplying the `session:` argument threaded through `base_find` and `save`, which decides whose access token the resource call carries, so that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.base_find`
- Entrypoint: `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`
- Attacker controls: the `session:` argument threaded through `base_find` and `save`, which decides whose access token the resource call carries
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
