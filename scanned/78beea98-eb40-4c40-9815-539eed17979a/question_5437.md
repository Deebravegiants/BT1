# Q5437: request — response content into logs via shop.dev host

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpClient#request` from `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request with a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite: because response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `X-Shopify-Access-Token` appears in no recorded request whose host is outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
