# Q1443: initialize — no freshness via nil vs empty

## Question
Starting from `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string, can an unprivileged attacker supply an omitted parameter presented as an empty string, so the signable string still contains the key so that nothing bounds the age of a signed callback, so a captured one stays valid indefinitely? Determine whether SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` still holds through `AuthQuery#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string
- Attacker controls: an omitted parameter presented as an empty string, so the signable string still contains the key
- Exploit idea: nothing bounds the age of a signed callback, so a captured one stays valid indefinitely
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: build the query two ways, assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both, and diff the two `to_signable_string` outputs
