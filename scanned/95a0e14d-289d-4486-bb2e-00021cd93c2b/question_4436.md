# Q4436: sanitize! — parse/resolve divergence via backslash separator

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.sanitize!` from `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop` with a shop string using a backslash instead of a slash (`https:\\evil.example\admin`), which `Addressable` and HTTParty disagree about: because what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Entrypoint: `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, reached from `ClientCredentials.client_credentials`, `RefreshToken.refresh_access_token` and `TokenExchange.migrate_to_expiring_token` with a caller-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: a shop string using a backslash instead of a slash (`https:\\evil.example\admin`), which `Addressable` and HTTParty disagree about
- Exploit idea: what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: stub_request on the attacker host, call the flow, and `assert_not_requested` any host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
