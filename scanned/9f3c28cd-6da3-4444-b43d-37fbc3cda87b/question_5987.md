# Q5987: socialize-debt via repay: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
`socialize-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944) writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Can an unprivileged caller of `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316), by choosing `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), use that to mint shares whose backing was never received, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:944` -> `socialize-debt`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt` writes down `lindex` by one ratio while reducing `assets` by a completely different `principal-reduction`. Reach it through `repay` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `repay` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path), and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
