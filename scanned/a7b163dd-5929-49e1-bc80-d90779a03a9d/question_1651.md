# Q1651: to_signable_string — canonicalisation gap via unsigned extra params

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling any query parameter the app reads that is not one of `code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp` at `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback, makes `AuthQuery#to_signable_string` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the string reconstructed by `URI.encode_www_form` is not byte-identical to what Shopify signed, so verification depends on incidental encoding? Test BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on and quantify Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery#to_signable_string`, the only bytes `HmacValidator` ever sees for an OAuth callback
- Attacker controls: any query parameter the app reads that is not one of `code`, `host`, `shop`, `state`, `timestamp`
- Exploit idea: the string reconstructed by `URI.encode_www_form` is not byte-identical to what Shopify signed, so verification depends on incidental encoding
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: sign a canonical query with the test secret, mutate an out-of-coverage field, and assert `validate` still returns true
