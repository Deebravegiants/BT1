# Q3682: jwt_session_id — key is predictable via online flag flip

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` through `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation while supplying control of whether the caller passes `online: true` or `false`, selecting between the online and offline key for the same token, so that `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `jwt_session_id(shop, user_id)`, a bare `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: control of whether the caller passes `online: true` or `false`, selecting between the online and offline key for the same token
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
