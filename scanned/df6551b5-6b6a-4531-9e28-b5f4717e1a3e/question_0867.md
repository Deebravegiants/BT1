# Q867: expired? — identity built by interpolation via caller-supplied id

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key at `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil, makes `Auth::Session#expired?` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#expired?`
- Entrypoint: `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: the `id:` keyword, which lets a session be constructed under any storage key
- Exploit idea: session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
