# Q5390: topic — lossy digest normalisation via relabelled shop header

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#topic` through `Request#topic`, reading the unsigned `shopify-topic` / `x-shopify-topic` header while supplying the `x-shopify-shop-domain` header, which no signature covers, set to a victim merchant's domain, so that `Base64.decode64` is permissive, so many distinct header values collapse to the same compared digest, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#topic`
- Entrypoint: `Request#topic`, reading the unsigned `shopify-topic` / `x-shopify-topic` header
- Attacker controls: the `x-shopify-shop-domain` header, which no signature covers, set to a victim merchant's domain
- Exploit idea: `Base64.decode64` is permissive, so many distinct header values collapse to the same compared digest
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `to_signable_string` equals the exact bytes later returned by `parsed_body.to_json`-round-tripped input, and diff on mismatch
