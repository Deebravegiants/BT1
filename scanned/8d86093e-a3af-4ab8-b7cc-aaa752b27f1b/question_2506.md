# Q2506: receive-underlying via deposit: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling `recipient`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account, so the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `recipient`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `deposit` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with `recipient`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
