# Q2166: request — string interpolation, not URL joining via session.shop

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator` to `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request, does `Clients::HttpClient#request` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient#request(request, response_as_struct:)`, the single outbound call site for every REST and GraphQL request
- Attacker controls: `session.shop`, which for several flows was never passed through `ShopValidator`
- Exploit idea: the URL is built by concatenation, so a crafted `path` changes host, scheme, query or fragment
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
