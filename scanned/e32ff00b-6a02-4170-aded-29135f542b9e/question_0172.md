# Q172: temp — identity built by interpolation via copy across identities

## Question
Can a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block, make `Auth::Session.temp` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.temp`
- Entrypoint: `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block
- Attacker controls: a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`
- Exploit idea: session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `expired?` is true, not false, for a session with no expiry once its token is past any plausible lifetime
