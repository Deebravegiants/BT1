# Q2058: to_signable_string — verified bytes != parsed bytes via base64 padding variants

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string` through `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else while supplying an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops, so that `@raw_body` at verification time and the string `JSON.parse` consumes are not guaranteed identical, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#to_signable_string`
- Entrypoint: `to_signable_string`, which returns `@raw_body` and nothing else
- Attacker controls: an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops
- Exploit idea: `@raw_body` at verification time and the string `JSON.parse` consumes are not guaranteed identical
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `to_signable_string` equals the exact bytes later returned by `parsed_body.to_json`-round-tripped input, and diff on mismatch
