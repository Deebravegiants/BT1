# Q1108: population via liquidate: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) let an unprivileged attacker who controls which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted reach `population` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it counts set bits to order the bucket search, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:81` -> `population`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted
- Exploit idea: `population` counts set bits to order the bucket search. Reach it through `liquidate` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with which collateral and debt asset pair is targeted, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
