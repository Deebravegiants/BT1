# Q466: initialize — rewrite is textual via case-varied prefix

## Question
Can a path beginning with `Admin/` or `/admin/`, probing the exact `start_with?("admin/")` comparison after the leading-slash strip, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch, make `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `.json` strip/append is a regex rewrite on a string that may already contain a query or fragment? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch
- Attacker controls: a path beginning with `Admin/` or `/admin/`, probing the exact `start_with?("admin/")` comparison after the leading-slash strip
- Exploit idea: the `.json` strip/append is a regex rewrite on a string that may already contain a query or fragment
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
