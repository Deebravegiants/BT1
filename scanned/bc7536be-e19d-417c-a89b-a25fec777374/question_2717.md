# Q2717: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — normalisation happens after the decision via IDN / Unicode label

## Question
Starting from `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment, can an unprivileged attacker supply a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip` so that the value returned is `uri.host`, not the fully normalised string the caller later interpolates? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, and whether the result reaches High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip`
- Exploit idea: the value returned is `uri.host`, not the fully normalised string the caller later interpolates
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
