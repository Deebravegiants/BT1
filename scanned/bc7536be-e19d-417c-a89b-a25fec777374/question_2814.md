# Q2814: begin_auth — private-app guard ordering via duplicated query keys

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Oauth.begin_auth` through `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop` while supplying repeated `shop=`/`state=` keys where the framework's last-wins parse differs from the value that was signed, so that `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: repeated `shop=`/`state=` keys where the framework's last-wins parse differs from the value that was signed
- Exploit idea: `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
