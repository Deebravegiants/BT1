# Q612: query — path built by concatenation via headers argument

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `headers:` argument, which becomes `extra_headers` and is merged over the client defaults to `Graphql::Client#query(query:, variables:, headers:, tries:, response_as_struct:, debug:)`, does `Clients::Graphql::Client#query` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `"#{@api_version}/graphql.json#{search_params}"` is textual, so a crafted version or flag reshapes the URL? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/graphql/client.rb` -> `Clients::Graphql::Client#query`
- Entrypoint: `Graphql::Client#query(query:, variables:, headers:, tries:, response_as_struct:, debug:)`
- Attacker controls: the `headers:` argument, which becomes `extra_headers` and is merged over the client defaults
- Exploit idea: `"#{@api_version}/graphql.json#{search_params}"` is textual, so a crafted version or flag reshapes the URL
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: pass a crafted `api_version` and assert the recorded path stays within the configured version
