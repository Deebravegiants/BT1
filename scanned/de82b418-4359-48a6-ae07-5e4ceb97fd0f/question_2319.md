# Q2319: hashes_per_tick is not deterministic across nodes (poh.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port reach `hashes_per_tick` in `entry/src/poh.rs` with two distinct inputs chosen so the digest input is ambiguous (missing domain separation), and make the dedup filter's view of a packet disagree with the packet that reaches banking, so that the invariant "For identical committed state and feature set, `hashes_per_tick` returns byte-identical results on every node." breaks and the result is Consensus/Safety Violation?

## Target
- File/function: `entry/src/poh.rs` -> `hashes_per_tick()` (around line 51)
- Entrypoint: raw QUIC/UDP packets and transaction batches sent by an unstaked client to the leader's public TPU port
- Attacker controls: two distinct inputs chosen so the digest input is ambiguous (missing domain separation)
- Exploit idea: Find input to `hashes_per_tick` whose result depends on iteration order, map ordering, cache warmth, timing, or float/HashMap behaviour rather than only on committed state.
- Invariant to test: For identical committed state and feature set, `hashes_per_tick` returns byte-identical results on every node.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Consensus/Safety Violation - honest nodes commit different state, bank-hash mismatch or fork (3,125-12,500 SOL)
- Fast validation: Differential test: run `hashes_per_tick` twice with shuffled input ordering and a cold vs warm cache; assert identical output.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can submit a transaction whose loading, sanitization, ALT resolution, or execution result differs between honest validators, causing bank-hash divergence, a fork, or an unbootable ledger replay.
