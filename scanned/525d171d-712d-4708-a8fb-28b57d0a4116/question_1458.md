# Q1458: begin_auth — cookie carries no shop via private/embedded config

## Question
Does `Oauth.begin_auth` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`? Show that `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap, that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself
- Exploit idea: `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
