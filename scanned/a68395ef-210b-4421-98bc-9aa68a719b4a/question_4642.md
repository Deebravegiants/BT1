# Q4642: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — differential between the two entry points via userinfo bypass

## Question
Starting from `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment, can an unprivileged attacker supply a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped so that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, and whether the result reaches High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a shop string that expresses userinfo without a literal `@` (encoded `%40`) so the `name.include?("@")` guard is skipped
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
