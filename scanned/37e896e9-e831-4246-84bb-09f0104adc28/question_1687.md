# Q1687: get-bitmap via liquidate: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing `debt-amount`, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `liquidate` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `debt-amount`, then read `get-bitmap` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
