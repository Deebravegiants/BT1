# Q3835: get_path_ids — cursor trusted via has_many element class

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated at `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires, makes `Rest::Base.get_path_ids` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path_ids`
- Entrypoint: `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires
- Attacker controls: the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
