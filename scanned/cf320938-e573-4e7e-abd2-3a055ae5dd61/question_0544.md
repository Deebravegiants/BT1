# Q0544: receive-underlying via redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption reach `receive-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it pulls the underlying from a named account, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:291` -> `receive-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `receive-underlying` pulls the underlying from a named account. Reach it through `redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `redeem` with the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
