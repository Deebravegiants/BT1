# Q1969: accrue-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `amount`, drive `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) — which accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`, and cause theft of unclaimed yield?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, then read `accrue-user-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
