# Q3836: strobe untransmute_state distinct objects share the

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `public governance call path (propose_update / vote_update / vote_new_parameters / vote_add_domains / start_keygen_instance / start_reshare_instance)` and use proposal contents, vote/removal timing, participant-churn timing, repeated calls, and any public arguments accepted by the method to drive the code path through `crates/threshold-signatures/src/crypto/proofs/strobe.rs::untransmute_state` so that distinct objects share the same identity or one object has multiple effective identities, breaking the invariant that security identities must be computed from one canonical serialized form, and leading to Unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: crates/threshold-signatures/src/crypto/proofs/strobe.rs:31::untransmute_state
- Entrypoint: `public governance call path (propose_update / vote_update / vote_new_parameters / vote_add_domains / start_keygen_instance / start_reshare_instance)`
- Attacker controls: proposal contents, vote/removal timing, participant-churn timing, repeated calls, and any public arguments accepted by the method
- Exploit idea: distinct objects share the same identity or one object has multiple effective identities
- Invariant to test: security identities must be computed from one canonical serialized form
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: construct semantically equivalent encodings that differ only in ordering, padding, or representation and compare derived hashes and storage lookups
