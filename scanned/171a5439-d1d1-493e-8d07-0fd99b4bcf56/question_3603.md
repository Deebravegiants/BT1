# Q3603: prooflessDeposit accounting via duplicate token addresses in erc20Addres [when the amount is set to the ]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker call prooflessDeposit (directly or through HinkalWrapper) using duplicate token addresses in erc20Addresses summed into one balanceAfter check, where performProoflessDepositChecks never enforces distinct tokens as the circuit does, so the on-chain commitments minted exceed the value actually transferred in, specifically when the amount is set to the field-boundary near CIRCOM_P (where modular encoding of amounts is exercised)?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Hinkal.sol :: prooflessDeposit / _handleTransfersFromProoflessDeposit
- Entrypoint: Hinkal.prooflessDeposit
- Attacker controls: erc20Addresses, amounts, stealthAddressStructures, msg.value, createBlockedUtxos
- Exploit idea: break the per-token balanceAfter-balanceBefore==amount check while over-minting leaves
- Invariant to test: sum of on-chain UTXO amounts minted == net value transferred into Hinkal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: minting shielded value without backing (protocol insolvency)
- Fast validation: Foundry: call prooflessDeposit, assert credited leaf value > vault balance delta
