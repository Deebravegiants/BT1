# Q2992: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — no shop cross-check via chosen cookie value

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check to `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims, does `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request? Close the question on SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
