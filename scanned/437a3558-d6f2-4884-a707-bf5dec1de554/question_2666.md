# Q2666: refresh_token_expired? — nil means valid via concurrent temp

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session at `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil, makes `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?`
- Entrypoint: `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session
- Exploit idea: `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
