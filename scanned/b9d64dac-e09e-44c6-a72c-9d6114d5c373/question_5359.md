# Q5359: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), by choosing the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, then read `calc-liquidation-params` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
