# Q1467: Unlock-boundary bypass via stake_all under victim pair epoch boundary dust threshold

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route through `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake_all()` with one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked and dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding so the `unstaked_available_epoch_height <= env::epoch_height()` check is satisfied one epoch too early, or so a legitimate unstaked balance becomes withdrawable only after an extra epoch, creating either early extraction or permanent user loss?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake_all` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_stake` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::inner_unstake`, `unstaked_available_epoch_height`, and `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_withdraw`
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake_all()`
- Attacker controls: pre-existing unstaked balance, account splits, reward timing, and whether full-position conversion leaves dust; one attacker EOA acting against a passive victim account that is already staked; the attacker straddles an epoch transition where the pool has a small positive reward to settle; dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding
- Exploit idea: Build a sequence that mixes full and partial unstakes before using `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::stake_all()` near the exact unlock boundary.
- Invariant to test: Unstaked balances must become withdrawable no earlier and no later than the intended unlock epoch for the exact shares burned.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Stealing or loss of funds
- Fast validation: Epoch-by-epoch simulation around the fourth unlock epoch; compare partial and full unstake paths and assert that withdrawal eligibility flips exactly once at the expected boundary.
