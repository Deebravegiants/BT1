# Q4368: total-assets via deposit: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-out` reach `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-out`
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `deposit` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz `min-out` across its boundary values through `deposit` in simnet and assert `total-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
