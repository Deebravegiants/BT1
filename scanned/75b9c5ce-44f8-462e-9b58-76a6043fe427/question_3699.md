# Q3699: calc-index-next via liquidate-redeem: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) applies a multiplier to the current index. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the redemption receiver, use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset and producing temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-index-next` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the redemption receiver, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
