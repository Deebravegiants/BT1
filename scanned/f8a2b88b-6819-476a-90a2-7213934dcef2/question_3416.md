# Q3416: normalize remote config value stale config replay via normalizeRemoteConfigValue

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `port`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `normalizeRemoteConfigValue` in `features/feature-flags/atoms/utils/normalize-remote-config-value.js` make cache validation skip a required refresh and preserve attacker-beneficial state, violating the invariant that config normalization must not widen privileges or weaken default security posture, and leading to `Direct theft of user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/feature-flags/atoms/utils/normalize-remote-config-value.js::normalizeRemoteConfigValue
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: persisted configuration state, cache validators, and normal startup / resume timing
- Exploit idea: make cache validation skip a required refresh and preserve attacker-beneficial state
- Invariant to test: config normalization must not widen privileges or weaken default security posture
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: seed the persisted config atom with stale or conflicting values, restart the module, and assert safer defaults or fresh values win before sensitive actions occur
