# Q5792: increment via repay: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) reach `increment` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it advances the user-id nonce, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:137` -> `increment`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path)
- Exploit idea: `increment` advances the user-id nonce. Reach it through `repay` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `repay` twice with `amount`, including far above the real debt (the capping path) varied, and assert that the value `increment` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
