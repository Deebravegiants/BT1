# Q5534: uri_from_shop_domain — nil-safe guard skipped via IDN / Unicode label

## Question
Can a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`, make `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.uri_from_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: the private `uri_from_shop_domain` normalisation step that downcases, strips, rejects `@` and prepends `https://` before `Addressable::URI.parse`
- Attacker controls: a shop string using non-ASCII or Unicode-normalising labels (fullwidth dot, Cyrillic homoglyph, soft hyphen) that survive `downcase.strip`
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
