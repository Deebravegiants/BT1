# Q3038: make_request — caller headers win via resource id injection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request` through the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers` while supplying an id segment taken from user input, e.g. `orders/#{params[:id]}` where the id contains `/` or `?`, so that `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: an id segment taken from user input, e.g. `orders/#{params[:id]}` where the id contains `/` or `?`
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a user-supplied resource id containing `/`, `?` or `#` cannot change the recorded request path beyond one segment
