# Q4950: accrue-user-debts via collateral-remove-redeem: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211) while controlling remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz remaining zToken collateral whose price moves with the redeem across its boundary values through `collateral-remove-redeem` in simnet and assert `accrue-user-debts` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
