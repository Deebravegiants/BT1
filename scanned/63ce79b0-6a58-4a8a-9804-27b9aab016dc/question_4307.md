# Q4307: insert via supply-collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
`insert` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159) rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing `amount`, use that to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:159` -> `insert`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `insert` rewrites the whole registry entry for a user id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `supply-collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
