# Q1172: receive-tokens via liquidate-multi: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it pulls an asset from a named account, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the full batch list and its ordering varied, and assert that the value `receive-tokens` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
