# Q3077: scale-debt-for-liquidation via liquidate: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `debt-amount`, drive `scale-debt-for-liquidation` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858) — which re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:858` -> `scale-debt-for-liquidation`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `debt-amount`
- Exploit idea: `scale-debt-for-liquidation` re-scales collateral by `scaled-to-remove / scaled-debt` after the debt was already capped. Reach it through `liquidate` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `debt-amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
