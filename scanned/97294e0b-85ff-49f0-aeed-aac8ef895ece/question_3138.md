# Q3138: generate remote config url unsafe config merge via generateRemoteConfigUrl

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `port`, `config`, or stale-state timing so that `generateRemoteConfigUrl` in `features/remote-config/module/generate-remote-config-url.ts` replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent, violating the invariant that remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context, and leading to `Direct theft of user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/remote-config/module/generate-remote-config-url.ts::generateRemoteConfigUrl
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: default-enabled configuration fields that toggle security-sensitive behavior
- Exploit idea: replay stale configuration so a security-sensitive rule remains weaker than the current server intent
- Invariant to test: remote configuration and fee data must stay bound to the intended environment and account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: seed the persisted config atom with stale or conflicting values, restart the module, and assert safer defaults or fresh values win before sensitive actions occur
