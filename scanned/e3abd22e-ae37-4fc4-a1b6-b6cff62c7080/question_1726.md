# Q1726: calc-multiplier-delta via repay: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-multiplier-delta` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag, so the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:170` -> `calc-multiplier-delta`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `calc-multiplier-delta` compounds a rate over `time-delta` with a caller-independent rounding flag. Reach it through `repay` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
