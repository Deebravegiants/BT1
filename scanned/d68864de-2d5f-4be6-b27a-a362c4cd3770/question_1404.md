# Q1404: process — no replay tracking via unregistered topic

## Question
Can a topic with no handler, exercising the `NoWebhookHandler` path and what it reveals, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Webhooks::Registry.process(request)`, the entry point of every app's public webhook route, make `Webhooks::Registry.process` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that no delivery-id or timestamp bookkeeping bounds re-delivery? The binding to test is SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registry.rb` -> `Webhooks::Registry.process`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Webhooks::Registry.process(request)`, the entry point of every app's public webhook route
- Attacker controls: a topic with no handler, exercising the `NoWebhookHandler` path and what it reveals
- Exploit idea: no delivery-id or timestamp bookkeeping bounds re-delivery
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: register two handlers, submit one signed body with each topic header, and assert dispatch follows the signature rather than the header
