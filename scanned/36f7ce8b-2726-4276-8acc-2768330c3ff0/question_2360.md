# Q2360: initialize — version chosen per call via traversal to another version

## Question
Starting from `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch, can an unprivileged attacker supply `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure so that the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch
- Attacker controls: `../<other version>/` segments that move the request to an API version the app did not configure
- Exploit idea: the api-version override is per-instance and unvalidated against `SUPPORTED_ADMIN_VERSIONS` at this layer
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a user-supplied resource id containing `/`, `?` or `#` cannot change the recorded request path beyond one segment
