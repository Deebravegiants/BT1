# Q4133: current_session_id — fallback weakens the strong path via cookie plus token

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops to `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves, does `SessionUtils.current_session_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.current_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves
- Attacker controls: a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops
- Exploit idea: an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
