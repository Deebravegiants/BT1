# Q4922: serialized_error — header override ordering via empty access token

## Question
Starting from `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers, can an unprivileged attacker supply a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response so that `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
