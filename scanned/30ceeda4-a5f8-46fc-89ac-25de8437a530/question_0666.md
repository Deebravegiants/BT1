# Q0666: get-cached-indexes via redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `amount` of shares burned, can an unprivileged attacker make `get-cached-indexes` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944) mint shares whose backing was never received? `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:944` -> `get-cached-indexes`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `get-cached-indexes` reads the per-block cache entry that `resolve-ztoken` and the debt conversions depend on. Reach it through `redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` of shares burned across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `get-cached-indexes` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
