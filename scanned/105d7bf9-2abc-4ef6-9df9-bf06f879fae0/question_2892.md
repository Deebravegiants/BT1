# Q2892: create_instance — method shadowing via attribute shadowing a method

## Question
Starting from `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state` so that a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Rest::Base.create_instance`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.create_instance`
- Entrypoint: `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`
- Attacker controls: a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state`
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
