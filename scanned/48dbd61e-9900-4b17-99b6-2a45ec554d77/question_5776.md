# Q5776: unified_admin? — validated value discarded via case-varied admin label

## Question
Starting from the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a host whose first label is `Admin`/`ADMIN` before downcasing, or `admin` on a non-trusted registrable domain so that the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a host whose first label is `Admin`/`ADMIN` before downcasing, or `admin` on a non-trusted registrable domain
- Exploit idea: the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: stub_request on the attacker host, call the flow, and `assert_not_requested` any host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
