# Q5308: create_instance — read-only filter applied late via original_state diff

## Question
Does `Rest::Base.create_instance` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends at `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`? Show that the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.create_instance`
- Entrypoint: `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`
- Attacker controls: the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
