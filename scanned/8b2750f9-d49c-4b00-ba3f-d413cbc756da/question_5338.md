# Q5338: balanceDif accounting with an ERC777 token with a tokensReceived hook via a DepositOnChainUtxos external action [when the external action is Em]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker route a DepositOnChainUtxos external action using an ERC777 token with a tokensReceived hook, so that the hook re-enters Hinkal during the transfer, and make Hinkal.transact's post-transfer check `balanceDif == (onChainCreation ? 0 : amountChanges[i]) + utxoAmount` hold while the vault actually receives less value than the shielded UTXOs it mints, specifically when the external action is Emporium with signerAddress zero (where the unsigned stateless op path runs)?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/Hinkal.sol :: transact / DepositOnChainUtxosExternalAction.runAction
- Entrypoint: Hinkal.transact
- Attacker controls: erc20TokenAddresses, amountChanges, slippageValues, the deployed token, externalActionData
- Exploit idea: exploit that getBalancesForArray snapshots via balanceOf while the hook re-enters Hinkal during the transfer
- Invariant to test: net tokens entering Hinkal == sum(amountChanges) + sum(on-chain UTXO amounts minted)
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: minting shielded value without backing (protocol insolvency)
- Fast validation: Foundry: deploy the token, run the tx, assert vault balance delta < credited UTXO value
