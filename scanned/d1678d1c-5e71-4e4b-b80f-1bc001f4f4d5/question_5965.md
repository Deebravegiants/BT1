# Q5965: vault-system-borrow via liquidate: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling `borrower`, any third-party principal, drive `vault-system-borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198) — which routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id — to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, breaking the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:198` -> `vault-system-borrow`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `borrower`, any third-party principal
- Exploit idea: `vault-system-borrow` routes a borrow to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `liquidate` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate` with `borrower`, any third-party principal, then read `vault-system-borrow` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
