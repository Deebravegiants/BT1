# Q0292: calc-liquidation-params via liquidate-multi: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the trait principals supplied per entry reach `calc-liquidation-params` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:739` -> `calc-liquidation-params`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `calc-liquidation-params` chains the factor, the exponent curve, the penalty bound and the max repayable amount in one helper. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
