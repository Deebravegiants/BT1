# Q1155: calc-utilization via collateral-remove: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`calc-utilization` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164) divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), by choosing whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:164` -> `calc-utilization`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch)
- Exploit idea: `calc-utilization` divides debt by available liquidity, which can exceed BPS when debt outruns assets. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-utilization` touches, run `collateral-remove` with whether the position has any enabled debt row (the has-debt branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
