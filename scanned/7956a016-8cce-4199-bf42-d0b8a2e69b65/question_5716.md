# Q5716: resolve-pyth via supply-collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
