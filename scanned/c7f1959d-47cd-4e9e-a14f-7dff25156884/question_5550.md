# Q5550: resolve-dia via call-ststx-ratio: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015) while controlling the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve-dia` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:326` -> `resolve-dia`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `resolve-dia` derives a (string-ascii 32) key from a (buff 32) ident. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched across its boundary values through `call-ststx-ratio` in simnet and assert `resolve-dia` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
