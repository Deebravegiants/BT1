# Q3330: total-assets via liquidate-redeem: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-assets` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs, so the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury would fail, yielding temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:334` -> `total-assets`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `total-assets` adds `(- debt borrowed)` as accrued interest that no token in the vault yet backs. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `total-assets` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
