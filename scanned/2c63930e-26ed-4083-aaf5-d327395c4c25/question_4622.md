# Q4622: serialized_error — header override ordering via absolute path

## Question
Does `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a `path` beginning with `/` or `//host`, which changes the authority the interpolated URL resolves to at `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers? Show that `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: a `path` beginning with `/` or `//host`, which changes the authority the interpolated URL resolves to
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` is merged last, so a caller-influenced header wins over the security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
