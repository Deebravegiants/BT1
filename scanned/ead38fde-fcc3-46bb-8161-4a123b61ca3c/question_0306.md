# Q306: Clients::HttpRequest — verify checks shape, not safety via tries value

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpRequest` from the `HttpRequest` struct itself, carrying `http_method`, `path`, `body`, `body_type`, `query`, `extra_headers` and `tries` with the `tries` prop, controlling how many times an authenticated request is repeated: because `verify` only validates the method enum and body/body_type pairing; it never inspects `path`, `query` or `extra_headers`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_request.rb` -> `Clients::HttpRequest`
- Entrypoint: the `HttpRequest` struct itself, carrying `http_method`, `path`, `body`, `body_type`, `query`, `extra_headers` and `tries`
- Attacker controls: the `tries` prop, controlling how many times an authenticated request is repeated
- Exploit idea: `verify` only validates the method enum and body/body_type pairing; it never inspects `path`, `query` or `extra_headers`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: assert `verify` rejects a `path` that changes the authority of the final URL
