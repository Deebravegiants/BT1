# Q1264: initialize — no iss/dest binding via own-shop id token

## Question
Can a genuine session token issued to the attacker's own shop, signed with the same `api_secret_key` that serves every install of the app, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header, make `JwtPayload#initialize` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop? The binding to test is SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: a genuine session token issued to the attacker's own shop, signed with the same `api_secret_key` that serves every install of the app
- Exploit idea: the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
