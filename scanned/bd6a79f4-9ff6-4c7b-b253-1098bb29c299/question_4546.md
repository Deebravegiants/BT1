# Q4546: send-tokens via liquidate-multi: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), can an unprivileged attacker make `send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
