# Q4352: offline_session_id — fallback weakens the strong path via cookie plus token

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` from `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation with a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops: because an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops
- Exploit idea: an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
