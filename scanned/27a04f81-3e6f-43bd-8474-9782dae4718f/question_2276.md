# Q2276: tee monitor_allowed_launcher_compose_hashes distinct objects share the

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `submit_participant_info / verify_tee` and use attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification to drive the code path through `crates/node/src/indexer/tee.rs::monitor_allowed_launcher_compose_hashes` so that distinct objects share the same identity or one object has multiple effective identities, breaking the invariant that security identities must be computed from one canonical serialized form, and leading to Unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: crates/node/src/indexer/tee.rs:98::monitor_allowed_launcher_compose_hashes
- Entrypoint: `submit_participant_info / verify_tee`
- Attacker controls: attestation bytes, node identity fields, responder/signer keys, repeated submissions, and timing around cleanup or re-verification
- Exploit idea: distinct objects share the same identity or one object has multiple effective identities
- Invariant to test: security identities must be computed from one canonical serialized form
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: construct semantically equivalent encodings that differ only in ordering, padding, or representation and compare derived hashes and storage lookups
