# Q1236: set_timestamp can strand user funds permanently (vote_transaction.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI reach `set_timestamp` in `vote/src/vote_transaction.rs` with an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation, and drive the target account into a state that no later instruction will accept, so that the invariant "Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `vote/src/vote_transaction.rs` -> `set_timestamp()` (around line 92)
- Entrypoint: a system/stake/vote instruction sent by an ordinary funded keypair, directly or via CPI
- Attacker controls: an interleaving where the write lands between the read and the validation
- Exploit idea: Drive an account through `set_timestamp` into a state no subsequent instruction accepts, so the owner can never withdraw.
- Invariant to test: Every reachable account state has a reachable exit that returns lamports to the owner.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Exhaustive state-machine test over `set_timestamp`'s transitions; assert every reachable state has a path back to a withdrawable state.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
High. An unprivileged attacker can bypass account-lock, reserved-key, writable-declaration, or loaded-accounts-data-size limits and write to or read state the transaction never declared or paid for.
