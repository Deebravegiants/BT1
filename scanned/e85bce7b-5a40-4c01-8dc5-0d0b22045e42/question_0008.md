# Q8: exchange_token — error branch reveals verdict via non-embedded / private config

## Question
Starting from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token, can an unprivileged attacker supply an app configuration that flips the `Context.private?` and `Context.embedded?` guards so that distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `TokenExchange.exchange_token`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/token_exchange.rb` -> `TokenExchange.exchange_token`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::TokenExchange.exchange_token(session_token:, requested_token_type:, shop:)`, reached from any embedded route that trades a session token for an access token
- Attacker controls: an app configuration that flips the `Context.private?` and `Context.embedded?` guards
- Exploit idea: distinguishing `invalid_subject_token` from other 400s creates an oracle over token validity
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: pass a validated `shop:` that differs from `dest` and assert the code raises rather than silently preferring `dest`
