# Q4632: parsed_body — handler chosen by unsigned data via base64 padding variants

## Question
Trace `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body` from `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification with an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops: because `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#parsed_body`
- Entrypoint: `parsed_body`, a `JSON.parse(@raw_body)` performed after verification
- Attacker controls: an hmac header with altered padding, whitespace or non-alphabet characters that `Base64.decode64` silently drops
- Exploit idea: `Registry.process` dispatches on `request.topic` before any per-topic authorisation exists
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: sign one body with the test secret, POST it twice with different `x-shopify-shop-domain` values, assert the handler receives two different shops for one signature
