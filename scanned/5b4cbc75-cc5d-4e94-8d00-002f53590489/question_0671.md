# Q0671: oracle-price-legal via call-ststx-ratio: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
`oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Can an unprivileged caller of `call-ststx-ratio` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015), by choosing the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, use that to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, violating the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `call-ststx-ratio` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1015`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `call-ststx-ratio` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `call-ststx-ratio` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the block and transaction position at which the external ratio is fetched, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
