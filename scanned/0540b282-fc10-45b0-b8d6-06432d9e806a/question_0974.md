# Q0974: total-debt via supply-collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `total-debt` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328) mint shares whose backing was never received? `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:328` -> `total-debt`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `total-debt` computes cumulative debt from `principal-scaled` and `index`. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg varied, and assert that the value `total-debt` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
