# Q3263: resolve-pyth via collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing `amount`, use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-add` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
