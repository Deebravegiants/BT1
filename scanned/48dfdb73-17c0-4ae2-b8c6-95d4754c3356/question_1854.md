# Q1854: == — temp restores unconditionally via shop with separator

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair at `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches, makes `Auth::Session#==` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#==`
- Entrypoint: `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches
- Attacker controls: a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair
- Exploit idea: the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
