# Q3470: expired? — copy preserves the key via concurrent temp

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session#expired?` from `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil with overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session: because `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#expired?`
- Entrypoint: `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session
- Exploit idea: `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
