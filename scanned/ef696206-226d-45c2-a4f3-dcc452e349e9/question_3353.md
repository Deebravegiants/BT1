# Q3353: initialize — presence check != usage via own-shop signed body

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#initialize` through `Request.new(raw_body:, headers:)`, called by the app's public webhook endpoint on every inbound POST while supplying a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers, so that `initialize` only requires `topic`, `hmac-sha256` and `shop-domain` to exist, never that they are well-formed, breaking the requirement that BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Request.new(raw_body:, headers:)`, called by the app's public webhook endpoint on every inbound POST
- Attacker controls: a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers
- Exploit idea: `initialize` only requires `topic`, `hmac-sha256` and `shop-domain` to exist, never that they are well-formed
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `Request#hmac` yields the same value for two different header strings, then assert `HmacValidator.validate` accepts both
