# Q3167: helpers cache-validator skip via isFreezable

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `headers`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `isFreezable` in `features/remote-config/module/helpers.ts` apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context, violating the invariant that security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/remote-config/module/helpers.ts::isFreezable
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: an older-but-well-formed config blob that survives wallet restart or restore
- Exploit idea: apply config or fee data from one environment, account, or network context to another context
- Invariant to test: security-sensitive configuration must fail safe on stale, conflicting, or partially updated state
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: load config for one network or account context, switch context, and ensure fee or policy data is not silently reused
