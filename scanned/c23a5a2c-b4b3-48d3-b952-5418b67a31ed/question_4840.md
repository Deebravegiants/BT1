# Q4840: initialize — header collision via http_ prefix stripping

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a header literally named `http_shopify-topic`, whose `sub("http_","")` rewrite creates a second claimant for one key to `Request.new(raw_body:, headers:)`, called by the app's public webhook endpoint on every inbound POST, does `Webhooks::Request#initialize` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup? Close the question on SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Request.new(raw_body:, headers:)`, called by the app's public webhook endpoint on every inbound POST
- Attacker controls: a header literally named `http_shopify-topic`, whose `sub("http_","")` rewrite creates a second claimant for one key
- Exploit idea: two spellings of one logical header resolve differently in `initialize`'s presence check than in `shopify_header`'s lookup
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: sign one body with the test secret, POST it twice with different `x-shopify-shop-domain` values, assert the handler receives two different shops for one signature
