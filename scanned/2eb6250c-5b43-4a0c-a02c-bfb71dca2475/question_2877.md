# Q2877: offline_session_id — caller decides identity shape via empty token

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` through `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation while supplying an empty or whitespace `shopify_id_token`, exercising the `MissingJwtTokenError` boundary versus the cookie fallback, so that the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: an empty or whitespace `shopify_id_token`, exercising the `MissingJwtTokenError` boundary versus the cookie fallback
- Exploit idea: the `online` boolean, not the token, selects which identity is loaded
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
