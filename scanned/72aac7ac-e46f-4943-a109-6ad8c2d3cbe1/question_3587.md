# Q3587: serialized_error — host header split from connection host via deprecation header

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim to `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers, does `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim
- Exploit idea: when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
