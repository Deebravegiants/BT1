# Q0321: send-underlying via deposit: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), controlling `amount`, drive `send-underlying` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296) — which pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope — to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:296` -> `send-underlying`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `send-underlying` pushes the underlying under an `as-contract?` post-condition scope. Reach it through `deposit` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `send-underlying` touches, run `deposit` with `amount`, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
