# Q2625: index stale address cache reuse via index

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker connect through provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp and manipulate `port`, `port`, and request ordering so that `index` in `features/public-key-provider/module/index.ts` reuse trust, favorite, or auto-approve state from one origin for another origin or another account, breaking the invariant that asset-scope expansion must require explicit user approval for the final returned scope, and leading to `Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction`?

## Target
- File/function: features/public-key-provider/module/index.ts::index
- Entrypoint: provider public-key or xpub request from a connected dapp
- Attacker controls: an address, xpub, or public-key request with attacker-chosen account and asset parameters
- Exploit idea: reuse trust, favorite, or auto-approve state from one origin for another origin or another account
- Invariant to test: asset-scope expansion must require explicit user approval for the final returned scope
- Expected Immunefi impact: Changing sensitive details of other users (including modifying browser local storage) with up to one click of user interaction
- Fast validation: rotate the seed or switch active accounts after caching addresses or keys and assert stale cache entries are rejected or invalidated
