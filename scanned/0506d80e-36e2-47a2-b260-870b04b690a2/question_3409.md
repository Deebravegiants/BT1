# Q3409: normalize remote config value cross-context fee reuse via normalizeRemoteConfigValue

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `port`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `normalizeRemoteConfigValue` in `features/feature-flags/atoms/utils/normalize-remote-config-value.js` normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard, violating the invariant that cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/feature-flags/atoms/utils/normalize-remote-config-value.js::normalizeRemoteConfigValue
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: ETag or Last-Modified transitions combined with repeated load / update calls
- Exploit idea: normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard
- Invariant to test: cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: load config for one network or account context, switch context, and ensure fee or policy data is not silently reused
