# Q5857: collateral-remove via supply-collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406) — which decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes — to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:406` -> `collateral-remove`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `collateral-remove` decrements the map and writes the entry before `send-tokens` executes. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), then read `collateral-remove` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
