# Q3435: call-liquidate via liquidate-multi: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none)
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `call-liquidate` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with how many entries share one price snapshot (price-feeds is passed as none), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
