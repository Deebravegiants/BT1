# Q1061: find via liquidate: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382), controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, drive `find` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135) — which resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map — to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:135` -> `find`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `find` resolves an asset record from a principal through the `reverse` map. Reach it through `liquidate` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `liquidate` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
