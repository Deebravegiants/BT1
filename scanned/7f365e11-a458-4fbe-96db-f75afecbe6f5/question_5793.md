# Q5793: method_missing — dynamic dispatch on response data via response-driven attribute names

## Question
Can attribute names arriving in API response JSON, which become `public_send("#{attribute}=")` and `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}")` targets, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access, make `Rest::Base#method_missing` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#method_missing`
- Entrypoint: `method_missing(meth_id, val = nil)`, which turns arbitrary reads and writes into property access
- Attacker controls: attribute names arriving in API response JSON, which become `public_send("#{attribute}=")` and `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}")` targets
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
