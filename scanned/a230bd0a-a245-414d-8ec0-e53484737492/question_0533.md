# Q533: current_session_id — no shop cross-check via Bearer interior match

## Question
Starting from `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves, can an unprivileged attacker supply an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded so that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request? Determine whether SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host still holds through `SessionUtils.current_session_id`, and whether the result reaches Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.current_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::SessionUtils.current_session_id(shopify_id_token, cookies, online)`, called on every authenticated request the app serves
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` strips an interior occurrence and changes the token that gets decoded
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
