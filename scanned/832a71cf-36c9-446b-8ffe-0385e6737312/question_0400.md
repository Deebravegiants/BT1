# Q400: port transport stale session reuse via PortTransport

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge and control `port`, `port`, and `port` so that `PortTransport` in `libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/port-transport.js` make malformed input fail open and select a dangerous default path instead of being rejected, breaking the invariant that origin/session bindings must remain one-to-one across RPC requests, responses, and subscriptions, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/port-transport.js::PortTransport
- Entrypoint: connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge
- Attacker controls: two concurrent port sessions, reused request IDs, and response ordering
- Exploit idea: make malformed input fail open and select a dangerous default path instead of being rejected
- Invariant to test: origin/session bindings must remain one-to-one across RPC requests, responses, and subscriptions
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: unit-test reconnect/disconnect races and assert no stale approval, unlock, or import state is reused
