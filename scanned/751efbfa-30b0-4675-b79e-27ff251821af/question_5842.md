# Q5842: accrue-user-collateral via repay: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `accrue-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else, so the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:270` -> `accrue-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-collateral` accrues only rows that `is-ztoken` recognises, skipping everything else. Reach it through `repay` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
