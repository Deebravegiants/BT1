# Q3940: shopify_header — signature covers body only via underscore/dash aliasing

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling header names that collide after `downcase.sub("http_","").gsub("_","-")`, e.g. `HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_TOPIC` vs `X-Shopify-Topic` at the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`, makes `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `to_signable_string` returns `@raw_body`, so topic, shop, api-version and webhook-id are unauthenticated input travelling with a valid HMAC? Test SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string` and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header`
- Entrypoint: the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`
- Attacker controls: header names that collide after `downcase.sub("http_","").gsub("_","-")`, e.g. `HTTP_X_SHOPIFY_TOPIC` vs `X-Shopify-Topic`
- Exploit idea: `to_signable_string` returns `@raw_body`, so topic, shop, api-version and webhook-id are unauthenticated input travelling with a valid HMAC
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: sign one body with the test secret, POST it twice with different `x-shopify-shop-domain` values, assert the handler receives two different shops for one signature
