# Q3461: trusted_domains — nil-safe guard skipped via percent-encoded separator

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments to `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only, does `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
