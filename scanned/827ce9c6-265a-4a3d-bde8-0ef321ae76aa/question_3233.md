# Q3233: unpack-u16 via collateral-remove-redeem: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211), controlling `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, drive `unpack-u16` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259) — which unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:259` -> `unpack-u16`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1211`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption
- Exploit idea: `unpack-u16` unpacks eight u16 curve fields from one packed word. Reach it through `collateral-remove-redeem` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `collateral-remove-redeem` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount` used for BOTH the collateral removal and the share redemption, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
