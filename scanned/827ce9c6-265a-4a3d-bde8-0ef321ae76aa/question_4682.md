# Q4682: call-liquidate via liquidate-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the redemption receiver, can an unprivileged attacker make `call-liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:907` -> `call-liquidate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the redemption receiver
- Exploit idea: `call-liquidate` invokes `liquidate` with `none` for price-feeds, so a whole batch shares one snapshot. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the redemption receiver varied, and assert that the value `call-liquidate` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
