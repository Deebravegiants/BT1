# Q4420: refresh via supply-collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg reach `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
