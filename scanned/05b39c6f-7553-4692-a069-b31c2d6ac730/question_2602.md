# Q2602: principal-ratio-reduction via deposit: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763) while controlling the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, can an unprivileged attacker make `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, so the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit would fail, yielding direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `deposit` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `deposit` with the vault's supply and asset state at the moment of the call, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
