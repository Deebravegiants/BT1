# Q5987: Aleo aleo1 with non-subgroup point via PoaBridge (signAndSendWithdrawalIntent)

## Question
Can an unprivileged user enter through `IntentsSDK.signAndSendWithdrawalIntent` with a caller-supplied `feeEstimation` on the PoaBridge route for Aleo with `destinationAddress` = `aleo1<x-not-in-subgroup>` (aleo1 with non-subgroup point) and make `validateAddress` (`validateAleoAddress`) accept a string that `createWithdrawIntentPrimitive` -> `ft_withdraw` to the `omft.near` token with memo `WITHDRAW_TO:<address>[:<memo>]` then forwards unchanged, so the address the PoA bridge relayer (bridge.chaindefuser.com) pays differs from the account the user controls and the withdrawal is lost?

## Target
- File/function: packages/intents-sdk/src/lib/validateAddress.ts `validateAleoAddress`; packages/intents-sdk/src/bridges/poa-bridge/poa-bridge.ts `validateWithdrawal` / `createWithdrawalIntents`
- Entrypoint: `IntentsSDK.signAndSendWithdrawalIntent` with a caller-supplied `feeEstimation` (skips `_estimateWithdrawalFee`'s `FeeExceedsAmountError` and re-validates only inside `createWithdrawalIntents`)
- Attacker controls: `destinationAddress` string (`aleo1<x-not-in-subgroup>`), `assetId` for a Aleo poa token, `destinationMemo`
- Exploit idea: subgroup check is done; confirm the cofactor-4 logic matches snarkVM for both y signs. Encoding path: `createWithdrawIntentPrimitive` -> `ft_withdraw` to the `omft.near` token with memo `WITHDRAW_TO:<address>[:<memo>]`.
- Invariant to test: For every string s where `validateAddress(s, 'aleo:0')` is true, the payout address derived by the PoA bridge relayer (bridge.chaindefuser.com) from the emitted intent must be the same account as s. Test: run validateAddress + createWithdrawalIntents on `aleo1<x-not-in-subgroup>` and inspect the emitted memo/recipient/receiver.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - funds delivered to a wrong address/chain/contract with no recovery (HackenProof: cross-chain address validation / withdrawal processing; Immunefi class: direct theft or permanent loss of user funds)
- Fast validation: vitest: call `validateAddress('aleo1<x-not-in-subgroup>', Chains.Aleo)`; then `createWithdrawalIntents` with mocked fee and assert the encoded destination byte-for-byte; compare against the poa bridge's documented accepted format.
