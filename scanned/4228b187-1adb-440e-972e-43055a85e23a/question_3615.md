# Q3615: sanitize_shop_domain — trusted list widened per call via scheme injection

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://` to a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`, does `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped? Close the question on SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and on Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://`
- Exploit idea: `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
