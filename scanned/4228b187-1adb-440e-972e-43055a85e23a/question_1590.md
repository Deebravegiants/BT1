# Q1590: initialize — no iss/dest binding via iss suffix

## Question
Starting from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header, can an unprivileged attacker supply an `iss` that merely ends with `/admin` (for example `https://evil.example/admin`), satisfying `admin_session_token?` so that the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `JwtPayload#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: an `iss` that merely ends with `/admin` (for example `https://evil.example/admin`), satisfying `admin_session_token?`
- Exploit idea: the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
