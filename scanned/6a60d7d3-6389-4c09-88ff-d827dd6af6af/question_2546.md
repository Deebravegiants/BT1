# Q2546: covers? — equality ignores expansion via compressed vs expanded asymmetry

## Question
Trace `Auth::AuthScopes#covers?` from `AuthScopes#covers?(auth_scopes)`, which apps call to decide whether a session may perform an operation with a comparison where the caller's required scopes are compressed and the session's are expanded: because `==` and `hash` use only `compressed_scopes`, so two sets with different effective permissions compare equal, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#covers?`
- Entrypoint: `AuthScopes#covers?(auth_scopes)`, which apps call to decide whether a session may perform an operation
- Attacker controls: a comparison where the caller's required scopes are compressed and the session's are expanded
- Exploit idea: `==` and `hash` use only `compressed_scopes`, so two sets with different effective permissions compare equal
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `==` distinguishes two scope sets whose expanded permissions differ
