# Q1574: mask-shift-combine via collateral-remove: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-shift-combine` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half, so the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422` -> `mask-shift-combine`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `mask-shift-combine` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
