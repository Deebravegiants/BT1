# Q2462: refresh via supply-collateral-add: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, can an unprivileged attacker make `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg varied, and assert that the value `refresh` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
