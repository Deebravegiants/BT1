# Q4428: find-collateral-amount via collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the position's existing collateral and debt composition reach `find-collateral-amount` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is temporary freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:609` -> `find-collateral-amount`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `find-collateral-amount` returns u0 for an absent asset, making a missing row indistinguishable from a zero holding. Reach it through `collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the position's existing collateral and debt composition across its boundary values through `collateral-add` in simnet and assert `find-collateral-amount` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
