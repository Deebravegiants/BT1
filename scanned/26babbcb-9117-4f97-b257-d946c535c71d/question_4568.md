# Q4568: is-healthy-with-mask via collateral-remove: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the set of assets held reach `is-healthy-with-mask` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:663` -> `is-healthy-with-mask`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the set of assets held
- Exploit idea: `is-healthy-with-mask` resolves an egroup for a caller-influenced mask and applies its LTV-BORROW. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-remove` twice with the set of assets held varied, and assert that the value `is-healthy-with-mask` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
