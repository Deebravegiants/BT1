# Q5931: find-superset via borrow: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
`find-superset` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262) returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing the `ft` trait principal, use that to mint shares whose backing was never received, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:262` -> `find-superset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `find-superset` returns the FIRST mask that is a superset, walking buckets in population order rather than finding the tightest. Reach it through `borrow` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `find-superset` touches, run `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
