# Q4093: trusted_domains — path segment trusted as identity via suffix-confusion host

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` from `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only with a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`: because the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a host whose registrable domain matches a trusted entry only under `Addressable`'s public-suffix view, e.g. `myshopify.com.evil.example` or `evil-myshopify.com`
- Exploit idea: the unified-admin branch trusts `uri.path` even though only the host was matched against `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
