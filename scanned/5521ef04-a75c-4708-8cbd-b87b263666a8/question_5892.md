# Q5892: base_find — path interpolation from ids via original_state diff

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.base_find` from `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params` with the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends: because ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.base_find`
- Entrypoint: `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`
- Attacker controls: the `original_state` snapshot that `attributes_to_update` diffs against, deciding which fields a `PUT` actually sends
- Exploit idea: ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
