# Q5082: append_first_party_development_headers — dev-mode rewrite in production via shop.dev host

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` through `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev` while supplying a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite, so that the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: a `session.shop` or `Host` header containing `.my.shop.dev`, entering the first-party development header rewrite
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
