# Q2359: append_first_party_development_headers — mutable shared header hash via query/fragment injection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` through `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev` while supplying a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query, so that `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: a `path` containing `?` or `#`, which truncates or rewrites the intended query
- Exploit idea: `headers = @headers` aliases the instance hash, so per-request mutations persist across requests on the same client
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
