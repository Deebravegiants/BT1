# Q3035: shop — unanchored substitution via dest with embedded separator

## Question
Can a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`, make `JwtPayload#shop` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: a `dest` whose host contains `_` or `/`, which later collides with the `#{shop}_#{sub}` session-id separator
- Exploit idea: `gsub("https://","")` removes every occurrence anywhere in the claim, not a leading scheme
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
