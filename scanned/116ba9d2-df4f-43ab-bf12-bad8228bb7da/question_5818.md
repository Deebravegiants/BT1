# Q5818: myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin — trusted list widened per call via empty path segment

## Question
Starting from `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment, can an unprivileged attacker supply a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant so that `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`
- Entrypoint: `myshopify_domain_from_unified_admin`, which returns `"#{uri.path.split('/').last}.myshopify.com"` from an unvalidated path segment
- Attacker controls: a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant
- Exploit idea: `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
