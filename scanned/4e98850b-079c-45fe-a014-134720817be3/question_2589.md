# Q2589: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — no shop cross-check via non-embedded config

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an app configured `is_embedded: false`, where the cookie is the only accepted credential at `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims, makes `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: an app configured `is_embedded: false`, where the cookie is the only accepted credential
- Exploit idea: nothing asserts the loaded session's `shop` matches the shop authenticated by this request
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
