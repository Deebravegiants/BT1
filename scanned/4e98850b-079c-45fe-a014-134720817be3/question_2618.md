# Q2618: from — nil means valid via scope string

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Auth::Session.from` through `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"` while supplying the `scope` string from the token response, parsed by `AuthScopes` with no validation, so that `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.from`
- Entrypoint: `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`
- Attacker controls: the `scope` string from the token response, parsed by `AuthScopes` with no validation
- Exploit idea: `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
