# Q0301: debt-add-scaled via liquidate-multi: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), controlling the full batch list and its ordering, drive `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) — which stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller — to credit one side of an accounting pair without the other, breaking the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, then read `debt-add-scaled` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
