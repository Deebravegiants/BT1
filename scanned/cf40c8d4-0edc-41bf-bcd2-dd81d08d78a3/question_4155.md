# Q4155: == — equality omits the token via scope string

## Question
Can the `scope` string from the token response, parsed by `AuthScopes` with no validation, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches, make `Auth::Session#==` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#==`
- Entrypoint: `Session#==`, used by callers to decide whether a stored session matches
- Attacker controls: the `scope` string from the token response, parsed by `AuthScopes` with no validation
- Exploit idea: `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: construct sessions for shops containing `_` and assert `Session.from` ids are injective across (shop, user) pairs
