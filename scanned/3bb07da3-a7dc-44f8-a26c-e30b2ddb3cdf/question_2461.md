# Q2461: admin_session_token? — rotation widens acceptance via iss/dest mismatch

## Question
Can a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check, make `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares
- Exploit idea: the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
