# Q3843: remove-user-collateral via collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`remove-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205) asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Can an unprivileged caller of `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020), by choosing call ordering within the block, use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:205` -> `remove-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: call ordering within the block
- Exploit idea: `remove-user-collateral` asserts sufficiency then `map-delete`s only on an exact zero. Reach it through `collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `remove-user-collateral` touches, run `collateral-add` with call ordering within the block, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
