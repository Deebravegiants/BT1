# Q0502: resolve via collateral-add: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the position's existing collateral and debt composition, can an unprivileged attacker make `resolve` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360) mint shares whose backing was never received? `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask, so the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-egroup.clar:360` -> `resolve`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the position's existing collateral and debt composition
- Exploit idea: `resolve` selects the efficiency group for a position mask. Reach it through `collateral-add` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-add` with the position's existing collateral and debt composition, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
