# Q3636: linear-interpolate via redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption reach `linear-interpolate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:221` -> `linear-interpolate`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption
- Exploit idea: `linear-interpolate` interpolates between two points, dividing by `(- x2 x1)`. Reach it through `redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the vault's available liquidity relative to the redemption across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `linear-interpolate` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
