# Q5626: sanitize_shop_domain — differential between the two entry points via nested host in path

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` from a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` with a unified-admin URL whose last path segment is itself a hostname, e.g. `https://admin.shopify.com/store/evil.example`: because `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a unified-admin URL whose last path segment is itself a hostname, e.g. `https://admin.shopify.com/store/evil.example`
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` where `sanitize!` raises, or vice versa, so callers that only check for `nil` behave differently from callers that rescue
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
