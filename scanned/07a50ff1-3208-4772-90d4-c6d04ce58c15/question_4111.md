# Q4111: sanitize_shop_domain — validator returns a non-Shopify host via percent-encoded separator

## Question
Does `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments at a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`? Show that `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`, that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a shop string with percent-encoded path/host separators such as `admin.shopify.com%2Fstore%2Fvictim` or `%2e%2e` segments
- Exploit idea: `sanitize_shop_domain` returns a string that is not a Shopify shop, and that string becomes `@base_uri` in `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
