# Q3429: calc-index-next via supply-collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), controlling `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), drive `calc-index-next` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183) — which applies a multiplier to the current index — to record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered, breaking the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal, and cause temporary freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:183` -> `calc-index-next`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `calc-index-next` applies a multiplier to the current index. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - temporary freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calc-index-next` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
