# Q4049: begin_auth — shop reaches HttpClient unvalidated via attacker-signed callback

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app to `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, does `Oauth.begin_auth` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app
- Exploit idea: `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
