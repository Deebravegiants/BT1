# Q691: create_instance — dynamic dispatch on response data via session argument

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.create_instance` from `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)` with the `session:` argument threaded through `base_find` and `save`, which decides whose access token the resource call carries: because `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.create_instance`
- Entrypoint: `create_instance(data:, session:, instance:)`, which builds objects from API response JSON via `public_send("#{attribute}=", ...)`
- Attacker controls: the `session:` argument threaded through `base_find` and `save`, which decides whose access token the resource call carries
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
