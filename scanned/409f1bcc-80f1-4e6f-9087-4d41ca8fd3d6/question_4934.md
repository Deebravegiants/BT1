# Q4934: calc-liq-debt-repay-real via liquidate-redeem: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) while controlling the vault whose share price the redemption moves, can an unprivileged attacker make `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:733` -> `calc-liq-debt-repay-real`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` re-derives debt from capped collateral by dividing by `(+ BPS liq-penalty)`. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-redeem` twice with the vault whose share price the redemption moves varied, and assert that the value `calc-liq-debt-repay-real` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
