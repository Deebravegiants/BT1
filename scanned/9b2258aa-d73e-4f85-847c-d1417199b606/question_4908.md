# Q4908: resolve-pyth via liquidate-redeem: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed reach `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed across its boundary values through `liquidate-redeem` in simnet and assert `resolve-pyth` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
