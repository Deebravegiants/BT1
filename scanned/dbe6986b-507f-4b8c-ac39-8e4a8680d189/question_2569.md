# Q2569: resolve-pyth via borrow: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), controlling the `ft` trait principal, drive `resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) — which reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident — to mint shares whose backing was never received, breaking the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`, and cause direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `borrow` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `borrow` with the `ft` trait principal, then read `resolve-pyth` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
