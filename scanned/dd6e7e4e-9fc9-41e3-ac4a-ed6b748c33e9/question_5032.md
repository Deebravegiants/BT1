# Q5032: principal-ratio-reduction via transfer: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `transfer` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation reach `principal-ratio-reduction` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:406` -> `principal-ratio-reduction`
- Entrypoint: `transfer` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:752`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation
- Exploit idea: `principal-ratio-reduction` derives a principal reduction from an amount, the scaled principal and the previewed debt. Reach it through `transfer` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of user funds at rest or in motion
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `transfer` with the timing relative to a pledge or a liquidation, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
