# Q2800: activate_session — setup? is a presence check via rest_disabled

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Context.activate_session` through `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` while supplying the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises, so that `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.activate_session`
- Entrypoint: `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`
- Attacker controls: the `rest_disabled` flag, which decides whether the REST client raises
- Exploit idea: `setup?` proves four strings are non-empty, not that any of them is well-formed
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `activate_session` is cleared at the end of a request cycle so a pooled thread cannot serve a stale tenant
