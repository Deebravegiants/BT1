# Q2344: price-resolve via supply-collateral-add: credit one side of an accounting pair without the other

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `amount` reach `price-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373) in a state where it credit one side of an accounting pair without the other? Given that it resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater, the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:373` -> `price-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `price-resolve` resolves a feed, applies the callcode transform, then checks `oracle-price-legal` and `oracle-timestamp-fresh` on the POST-transform value while advancing the per-key `last-update` only when the new timestamp is greater. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and credit one side of an accounting pair without the other.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `amount`, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
