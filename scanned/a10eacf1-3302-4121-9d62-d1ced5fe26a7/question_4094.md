# Q4094: validate_auth_callback — cookie value becomes the session id via scope_override

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling the `scope_override:` argument or the `redirect_path:` argument if the host route derives either from request input at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, makes `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that in the non-embedded branch the returned cookie's value is `session.id`, publishing the storage key to the browser? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: the `scope_override:` argument or the `redirect_path:` argument if the host route derives either from request input
- Exploit idea: in the non-embedded branch the returned cookie's value is `session.id`, publishing the storage key to the browser
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
