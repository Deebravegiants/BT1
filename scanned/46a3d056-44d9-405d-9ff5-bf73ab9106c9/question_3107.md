# Q3107: receive-tokens via borrow: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
`receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) pulls an asset from a named account. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `receiver`, including a contract principal, use that to count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims, violating the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `borrow` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
