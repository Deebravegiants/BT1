# Q5488: initialize — dev-mode rewrite in production via api_host config

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#initialize` through `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token` while supplying an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere, so that the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `HttpClient.new(base_path:, session:)`, which sets `@base_uri = "https://#{api_host || session.shop}"` and attaches `X-Shopify-Access-Token`
- Attacker controls: an `api_host` configured so `Host` is set from `session.shop` while the connection goes elsewhere
- Exploit idea: the `DevServer` branch fires whenever the constant happens to be defined, rewriting `Host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - credential or token leakage into log output or error messages (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
