# Q3215: get_path — read-only filter applied late via response-driven attribute names

## Question
Does `Rest::Base.get_path` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits attribute names arriving in API response JSON, which become `public_send("#{attribute}=")` and `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}")` targets at `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids? Show that the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids
- Attacker controls: attribute names arriving in API response JSON, which become `public_send("#{attribute}=")` and `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}")` targets
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
