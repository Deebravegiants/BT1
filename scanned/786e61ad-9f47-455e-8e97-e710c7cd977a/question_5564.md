# Q5564: get-bitmap via collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `get-bitmap` (mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on, the invariant that interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury breaks and the result is protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/registry/v0-assets.clar:145` -> `get-bitmap`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `get-bitmap` returns the global enabled bitmap that every position read filters on. Reach it through `collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: interest charged to borrowers equals interest distributed to suppliers plus treasury
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `get-bitmap` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
