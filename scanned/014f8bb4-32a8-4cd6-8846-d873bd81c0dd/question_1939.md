# Q1939: decode_token — no iss/dest binding via iss/dest mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#decode_token` through the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')` while supplying a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares, so that the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares
- Exploit idea: the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
