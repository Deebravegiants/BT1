# Q350: tx signer next_respond_signer the same logical data

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `sign` and use payload bytes, derivation path, domain_id, attached deposit, predecessor identity, repeated submission timing, and overlapping requests to drive the code path through `crates/node/src/indexer/tx_signer.rs::next_respond_signer` so that the same logical data changes meaning across modules, breaking the invariant that ordering-sensitive security logic must use one canonical participant, vote, or provider ordering, and leading to Balance manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: crates/node/src/indexer/tx_signer.rs:128::next_respond_signer
- Entrypoint: `sign`
- Attacker controls: payload bytes, derivation path, domain_id, attached deposit, predecessor identity, repeated submission timing, and overlapping requests
- Exploit idea: the same logical data changes meaning across modules
- Invariant to test: ordering-sensitive security logic must use one canonical participant, vote, or provider ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: permute attacker-controlled collections before and after conversion boundaries and compare the resulting hashes, thresholds, or routing choices
