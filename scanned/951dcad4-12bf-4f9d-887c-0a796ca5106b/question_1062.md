# Q1062: initialize — leeway on both ends via sub variants

## Question
Trace `JwtPayload#initialize` from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header with a `sub` claim that is absent, non-numeric, negative, zero-padded, or huge, changing `user_id_sub?` and the `#{shop}_#{sub}` key: because a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: a `sub` claim that is absent, non-numeric, negative, zero-padded, or huge, changing `user_id_sub?` and the `#{shop}_#{sub}` key
- Exploit idea: a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: mint a token with `iss` = shop A and `dest` = shop B under the test secret, assert `JwtPayload#shop` and assert which shop the subsequent token exchange requests
