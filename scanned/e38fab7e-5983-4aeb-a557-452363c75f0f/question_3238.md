# Q3238: debt-add-scaled via liquidate-multi: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the full batch list and its ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `debt-add-scaled` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442) leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects? `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller, so the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` would fail, yielding theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:442` -> `debt-add-scaled`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `debt-add-scaled` stamps `last-borrow-block` from `stacks-block-height` onto the named ACCOUNT, not the caller. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-multi` with the full batch list and its ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
