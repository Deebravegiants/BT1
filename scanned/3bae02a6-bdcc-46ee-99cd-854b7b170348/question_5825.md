# Q5825: resolve-interpolation-points via accrue: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `accrue` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835), controlling the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, drive `resolve-interpolation-points` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205) — which selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization — to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, breaking the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit, and cause protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:205` -> `resolve-interpolation-points`
- Entrypoint: `accrue` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:835`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block
- Exploit idea: `resolve-interpolation-points` selects the bracketing curve points for a utilization. Reach it through `accrue` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `accrue` call, then the attacker-shaped one with the block time at which accrual is first triggered in a block, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
