# Q1051: account_keys_iter mishandles duplicate/aliased accounts (transaction_accounts.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists reach `account_keys_iter` in `transaction-context/src/transaction_accounts.rs` with an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data, and have `account_keys_iter` read a stale copy of an account passed twice in the same instruction, so that the invariant "Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction." breaks and the result is Loss of Funds?

## Target
- File/function: `transaction-context/src/transaction_accounts.rs` -> `account_keys_iter()` (around line 481)
- Entrypoint: deploying an attacker-authored sBPF program and invoking it with crafted instruction data and account lists
- Attacker controls: an account owned by a program the caller controls, with attacker-chosen data
- Exploit idea: Pass the same account at two indices so `account_keys_iter` reads a stale copy and writes back a value computed from it, duplicating or erasing a balance.
- Invariant to test: Aliased account references observe a single coherent value throughout the instruction.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Loss of Funds - theft or creation of lamports/tokens without the owner's signature (6,250-25,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Unit test the path with the same pubkey at two indices; assert the final lamports match the single-reference case.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can craft a transaction whose fee, rent, rollback, or balance-commit accounting in the SVM lifecycle moves, mints, duplicates, or destroys lamports the signer does not own.
