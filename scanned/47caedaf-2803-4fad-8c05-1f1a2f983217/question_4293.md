# Q4293: calculate-asset-notional-value via collateral-remove: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107), controlling `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), drive `calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) — which normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold — to have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently, breaking the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`, and cause permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch)
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `calculate-asset-notional-value` touches, run `collateral-remove` with `amount` relative to the current collateral row (the removing-all branch), recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
