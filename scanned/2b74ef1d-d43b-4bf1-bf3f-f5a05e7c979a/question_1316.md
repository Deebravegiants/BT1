# Q1316: validate — verified value discarded via length-varied digest

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `HmacValidator.validate` through `ShopifyAPI::Utils::HmacValidator.validate`, the single arbiter of authenticity for both the OAuth callback and every inbound webhook while supplying a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling, so that the object verified is not the object subsequently acted on, breaking the requirement that SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`, and ending in Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/hmac_validator.rb` -> `HmacValidator.validate`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Utils::HmacValidator.validate`, the single arbiter of authenticity for both the OAuth callback and every inbound webhook
- Attacker controls: a digest of the wrong length, exercising `secure_compare`'s length handling
- Exploit idea: the object verified is not the object subsequently acted on
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: sign a body as UTF-8, re-present it as ASCII-8BIT, and assert the verification verdict is unchanged
