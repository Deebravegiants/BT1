# Q3182: save — method shadowing via attribute name with punctuation

## Question
Can a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`, make `Rest::Base#save` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#save`
- Entrypoint: `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`
- Attacker controls: a response key containing `-`, `?`, `!`, spaces or `@`, after `clean_key` rewriting
- Exploit idea: a property write can shadow or overwrite internal state such as the session or client held on the instance
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
