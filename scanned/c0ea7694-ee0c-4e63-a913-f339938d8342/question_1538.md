# Q1538: validate_auth_callback — error path leaks via expired cookie

## Question
Trace `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` from `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route with a `SessionCookie` presented after its 60-second `expires` has passed, which the gem never re-checks on the callback side: because `Errors::RequestAccessTokenError` and the HTTParty failure path surface response contents built from a request that carried `client_secret`, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: a `SessionCookie` presented after its 60-second `expires` has passed, which the gem never re-checks on the callback side
- Exploit idea: `Errors::RequestAccessTokenError` and the HTTParty failure path surface response contents built from a request that carried `client_secret`
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
