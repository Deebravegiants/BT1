# Q2912: shop — rotation widens acceptance via expired but rotated

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#shop` through `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")` while supplying a token that fails under the current secret and is retried under `old_api_secret_key` by the rescue branch, so that the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: a token that fails under the current secret and is retried under `old_api_secret_key` by the rescue branch
- Exploit idea: the rescue-and-retry under `old_api_secret_key` doubles the set of tokens accepted, with no expiry
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
