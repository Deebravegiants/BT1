# Q215: offline_session_id — interpolation collision via chosen cookie value

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` from `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation with the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check: because string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check
- Exploit idea: string concatenation with `_` makes distinct identities collide
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
