# Q2081: initialize — equality omits the token via copy across identities

## Question
Does `Auth::Session#initialize` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id` at `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable? Show that `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal, that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Session.new(shop:, id:, state:, access_token:, scope:, ...)`, whose `id` defaults to `SecureRandom.uuid` but is caller-overridable
- Attacker controls: a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`
- Exploit idea: `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
