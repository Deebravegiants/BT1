# Q5960: sanitize_shop_domain — nil-safe guard skipped via caller-supplied myshopify_domain

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call to a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`, does `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call
- Exploit idea: the `next if uri_domain.nil?` and `return nil if no_shop_name_in_subdomain` guards are evaluated per trusted domain, so ordering decides the verdict
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: stub_request on the attacker host, call the flow, and `assert_not_requested` any host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
