# Q4274: set_property — template selection is textual via pagination cursors

## Question
Can `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, make `Rest::Base#set_property` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: `prev_page_info` / `next_page_info` values taken from response `Link` headers and replayed into a subsequent request
- Exploit idea: `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
