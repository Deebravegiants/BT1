# Q3505: unified_admin? — trusted list widened per call via nested host in path

## Question
Trace `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` from the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin` with a unified-admin URL whose last path segment is itself a hostname, e.g. `https://admin.shopify.com/store/evil.example`: because `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a unified-admin URL whose last path segment is itself a hostname, e.g. `https://admin.shopify.com/store/evil.example`
- Exploit idea: `trusted_domains` mutates a dup of the constant with a caller-supplied value, so the trust set is request-scoped
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
