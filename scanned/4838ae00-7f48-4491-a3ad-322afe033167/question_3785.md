# Q3785: to_hash — read-only filter applied late via attribute shadowing a method

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base#to_hash` from `to_hash(saving)`, which walks `instance_variables` and filters `read_only_attributes` with a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state`: because the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#to_hash`
- Entrypoint: `to_hash(saving)`, which walks `instance_variables` and filters `read_only_attributes`
- Attacker controls: a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state`
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
