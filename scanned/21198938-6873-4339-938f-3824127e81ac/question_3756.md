# Q3756: mask-to-list-internal via borrow: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `mask-to-list-internal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries, the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:435` -> `mask-to-list-internal`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-internal` expands mask bits into a list bounded at 64 entries. Reach it through `borrow` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-internal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
