# Q3190: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — unauthenticated bytes become the key via chosen cookie value

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` from `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims with the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check: because the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: the `shopify_app_session` cookie, whose value the gem returns as the session key without any signature check
- Exploit idea: the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
