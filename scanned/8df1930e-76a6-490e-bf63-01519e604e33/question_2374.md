# Q2374: base_find — read-only filter applied late via read-only attribute

## Question
Starting from `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`, can an unprivileged attacker supply an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update` so that the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance? Determine whether AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right still holds through `Rest::Base.base_find`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.base_find`
- Entrypoint: `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`
- Attacker controls: an attribute listed in `read_only_attributes` presented in a payload that reaches `attributes_to_update`
- Exploit idea: the read-only filter runs at serialisation time, after values have already been set on the instance
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
