# Q1742: expired? — equality omits the token via copy across identities

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id` at `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil, makes `Auth::Session#expired?` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal? Test AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#expired?`
- Entrypoint: `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`
- Exploit idea: `Session#==` compares many fields; a caller using it to decide sameness may treat two sessions with different credentials as equal
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
