# Q2486: oracle-last-update via liquidate-multi: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) while controlling the trait principals supplied per entry, can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-last-update` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:939` -> `oracle-last-update`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `oracle-last-update` returns the stored monotonic timestamp for a `{type, ident}` key shared by every asset using that feed. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `liquidate-multi` twice with the trait principals supplied per entry varied, and assert that the value `oracle-last-update` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
