# Q2814: vault-accrue via redeem: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) while controlling `amount` of shares burned, can an unprivileged attacker make `vault-accrue` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:189` -> `vault-accrue`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount` of shares burned
- Exploit idea: `vault-accrue` dispatches accrual to one of six vaults by asset id. Reach it through `redeem` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `amount` of shares burned across its boundary values through `redeem` in simnet and assert `vault-accrue` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
