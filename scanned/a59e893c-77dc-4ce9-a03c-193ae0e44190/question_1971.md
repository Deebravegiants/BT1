# Q1971: resolve-pyth via liquidate-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`resolve-pyth` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312) reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:312` -> `resolve-pyth`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `resolve-pyth` reads the Pyth storage record for a 32-byte ident. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `resolve-pyth` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
