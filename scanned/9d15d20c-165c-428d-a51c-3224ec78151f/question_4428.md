# Q4428: trusted_domains — validated value discarded via empty path segment

## Question
Can a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only, make `ShopValidator.trusted_domains` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.trusted_domains`
- Entrypoint: `trusted_domains`, which appends the caller-supplied `myshopify_domain:` keyword to `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` for that call only
- Attacker controls: a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant
- Exploit idea: the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: stub_request on the attacker host, call the flow, and `assert_not_requested` any host outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`
