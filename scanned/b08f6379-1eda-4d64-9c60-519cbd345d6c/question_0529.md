# Q529: initialize — canonicalisation gap via array-style parameters

## Question
Can `shop[]=` / `state[]=` style keys that a Rack parse turns into arrays before they reach `AuthQuery.new`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string, make `AuthQuery#initialize` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the string reconstructed by `URI.encode_www_form` is not byte-identical to what Shopify signed, so verification depends on incidental encoding? The binding to test is BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on; the impact to prove is Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth/auth_query.rb` -> `AuthQuery#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `AuthQuery.new(code:, shop:, timestamp:, state:, host:, hmac:)`, built by the host app directly from the callback query string
- Attacker controls: `shop[]=` / `state[]=` style keys that a Rack parse turns into arrays before they reach `AuthQuery.new`
- Exploit idea: the string reconstructed by `URI.encode_www_form` is not byte-identical to what Shopify signed, so verification depends on incidental encoding
- Invariant to test: BYTE IDENTITY: the bytes passed to `compute_signature` == the bytes later parsed and acted on
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: sign a canonical query with the test secret, mutate an out-of-coverage field, and assert `validate` still returns true
