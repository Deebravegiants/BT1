# Q3952: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — unauthenticated bytes become the key via shop with underscore

## Question
Can a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims, make `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key
- Exploit idea: the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
