# Q1515: base_find — template selection is textual via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name to `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`, does `Rest::Base.base_find` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.base_find`
- Entrypoint: `base_find(session:, ids:, params:)`, called by every generated `find`/`all` with caller-supplied `ids` and `params`
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - scope or expiry check bypass granting an operation the session was never authorized for (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
