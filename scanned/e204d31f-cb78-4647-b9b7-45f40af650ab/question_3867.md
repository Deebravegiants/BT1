# Q3867: storage migration integrity downgrade via batchGet

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker trigger wallet import, restore, unlock, or startup path that reads persisted wallet state with attacker-controlled `port`, `name`, and persisted-state layout so that `batchGet` in `adapters/storage-mobile/src/storage.ts` use path, namespace, or metadata confusion to overwrite or read a different wallet's persisted state, violating the invariant that encrypted wallet material must be bound to the right seed, namespace, and account context, and leading to `Direct theft of user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: adapters/storage-mobile/src/storage.ts::batchGet
- Entrypoint: wallet import, restore, unlock, or startup path that reads persisted wallet state
- Attacker controls: serialized wallet state fields plus a lock / unlock / clear sequence
- Exploit idea: use path, namespace, or metadata confusion to overwrite or read a different wallet's persisted state
- Invariant to test: encrypted wallet material must be bound to the right seed, namespace, and account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Direct theft of user funds
- Fast validation: prepare two wallet contexts, persist state in one, then restore or migrate the other and assert ciphertext, metadata, and namespaces never cross-decrypt or cross-load
