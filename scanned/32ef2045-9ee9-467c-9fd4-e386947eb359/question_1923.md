# Q1923: get-position via supply-collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`get-position` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466) returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:466` -> `get-position`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `get-position` returns only rows whose bit is set in the ENABLED bitmap. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `get-position` touches, run `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
