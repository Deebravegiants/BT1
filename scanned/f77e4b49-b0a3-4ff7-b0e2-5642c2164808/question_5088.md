# Q5088: receive-tokens via liquidate-multi: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the full batch list and its ordering reach `receive-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it pulls an asset from a named account, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:256` -> `receive-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the full batch list and its ordering
- Exploit idea: `receive-tokens` pulls an asset from a named account. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the full batch list and its ordering across its boundary values through `liquidate-multi` in simnet and assert `receive-tokens` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
