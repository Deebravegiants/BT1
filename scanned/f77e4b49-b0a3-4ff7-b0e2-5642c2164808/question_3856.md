# Q3856: mask-shift-combine via repay: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `repay` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `mask-shift-combine` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half, the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:422` -> `mask-shift-combine`
- Entrypoint: `repay` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1316`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `mask-shift-combine` folds the 128-bit mask down by shifting the debt half by DEBT-OFFSET and OR-ing it onto the collateral half. Reach it through `repay` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `repay` with the `ft` trait principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
