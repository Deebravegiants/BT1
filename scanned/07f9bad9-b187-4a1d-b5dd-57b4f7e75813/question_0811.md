# Q811: unified_admin? — validated value discarded via scheme injection

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://` at the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`, makes `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id? Test SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a shop string that already carries a scheme (`http://`, `//`, `javascript:`, `file:`) so the `uri.scheme.nil?` branch never prepends `https://`
- Exploit idea: the caller validates one string but interpolates a different, unvalidated one into the URL or the session id
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: drive `ClientCredentials.client_credentials(shop: candidate)` under WebMock and assert the request body containing `client_secret` was never sent off-domain
