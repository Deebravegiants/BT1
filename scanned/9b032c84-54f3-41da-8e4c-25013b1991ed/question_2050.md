# Q2050: callback_address — regex injection via regex metacharacters in host

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling a `Context.host_name` containing regex metacharacters, since it is interpolated into a pattern unescaped at `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`, makes `Registrations::Http#callback_address` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that an unescaped interpolation into a `Regexp` changes what the match accepts? Test SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/registrations/http.rb` -> `Registrations::Http#callback_address`
- Entrypoint: `callback_address`, which returns `@path` as-is when it matches `%r{^https?://}`, prefixes the scheme when it matches `Context.host_name`, and otherwise appends to `Context.host`
- Attacker controls: a `Context.host_name` containing regex metacharacters, since it is interpolated into a pattern unescaped
- Exploit idea: an unescaped interpolation into a `Regexp` changes what the match accepts
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `callback_address` never returns a host outside the app's own origin
