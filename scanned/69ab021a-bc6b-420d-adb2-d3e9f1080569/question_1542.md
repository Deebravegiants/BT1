# Q1542: mask-to-list-collateral via supply-collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-to-list-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449) record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64, so the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` would fail, yielding permanent freezing of funds.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:449` -> `mask-to-list-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-collateral` expands a mask to a list of ids over ITER-UINT-64. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Fuzz the `ft` trait principal deciding which vault is routed to across its boundary values through `supply-collateral-add` in simnet and assert `mask-to-list-collateral` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
