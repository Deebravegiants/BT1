# Q2968: interest-rate via liquidate-redeem: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
Does `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the vault whose share price the redemption moves reach `interest-rate` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371) in a state where it make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount? Given that it interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization, the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` breaks and the result is theft of unclaimed yield.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:371` -> `interest-rate`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the vault whose share price the redemption moves
- Exploit idea: `interest-rate` interpolates the packed curve at the current utilization. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - theft of unclaimed yield
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate-redeem` with the vault whose share price the redemption moves, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
