# Q5541: set_property — path interpolation from ids via session argument

## Question
Can the `session:` argument threaded through `base_find` and `save`, which decides whose access token the resource call carries, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, make `Rest::Base#set_property` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: the `session:` argument threaded through `base_find` and `save`, which decides whose access token the resource call carries
- Exploit idea: ids are concatenated into the path template with no escaping or type check
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
