# Q5401: initialize — no iss/dest binding via sid claim

## Question
Can the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header, make `JwtPayload#initialize` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop? The binding to test is SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity
- Exploit idea: the constructor validates `aud` only; nothing asserts `iss` and `dest` describe the same shop
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
