# Q0696: dimensionsCheck gap: arrays whose lengths satisfy dimensionsC [when a prior tx in the same bl]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker submit arrays whose lengths satisfy dimensionsCheck but whose inner nullifier/commitment counts vary per token after index 0, so HinkalHelper.dimensionsCheck passes while the actual CircomData shape fed to formInputForCircom and the verifier differs from the claimed Dimensions, admitting a proof against a mismatched input vector, specifically when a prior tx in the same block left the action or tree in a partial state (where cross-tx residual state carries over)?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/HinkalHelper.sol :: dimensionsCheck / CircomDataBuilder.formInputForCircom
- Entrypoint: Hinkal.transact
- Attacker controls: inputNullifiers, outCommitments, encryptedOutputs, dimensions, feeStructure
- Exploit idea: satisfy the length checks while the effective shape diverges
- Invariant to test: the array shapes checked == the shapes consumed to build the verifier input
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: proof or verifier bypass (unproven state accepted)
- Fast validation: Foundry: craft arrays passing dimensionsCheck but mismatching the vector, assert acceptance
