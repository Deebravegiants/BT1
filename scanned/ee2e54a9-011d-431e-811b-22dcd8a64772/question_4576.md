# Q4576: add-user-collateral via collateral-remove: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `collateral-remove` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `receiver`, including a contract principal reach `add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-remove` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1107`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `collateral-remove` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `collateral-remove` with `receiver`, including a contract principal, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
