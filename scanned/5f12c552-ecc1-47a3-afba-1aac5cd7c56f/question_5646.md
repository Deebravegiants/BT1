# Q5646: save — template selection is textual via ids hash

## Question
Can the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`, make `Rest::Base#save` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#save`
- Entrypoint: `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`
- Attacker controls: the `ids:` hash passed to `base_find`, whose values are interpolated into the request path
- Exploit idea: `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
