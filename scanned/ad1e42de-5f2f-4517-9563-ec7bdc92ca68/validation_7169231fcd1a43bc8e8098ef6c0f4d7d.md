### Title
Unbounded Withdrawal Queue Accumulation Enables Temporary Freeze of User Withdrawals - (File: contracts/LRTWithdrawalManager.sol)

### Summary
`LRTWithdrawalManager.initiateWithdrawal()` imposes no per-user or global count limit on queued withdrawal requests. An attacker holding rsETH can flood the global FIFO queue with many minimum-sized requests, committing all available asset capacity and blocking legitimate users from initiating withdrawals. The same flood forces the operator's `unlockQueue` to iterate through an unbounded number of entries, causing unbounded gas consumption.

### Finding Description

`initiateWithdrawal()` accepts any non-zero amount of rsETH (subject only to `minRsEthAmountToWithdraw`) and unconditionally appends a new entry to the global queue via `_addUserWithdrawalRequest()`:

```solidity
// LRTWithdrawalManager.sol:162-175
if (rsETHUnstaked == 0 || rsETHUnstaked < minRsEthAmountToWithdraw[asset]) {
    revert InvalidAmountToWithdraw();
}
...
assetsCommitted[asset] += expectedAssetAmount;
_addUserWithdrawalRequest(asset, rsETHUnstaked, expectedAssetAmount);
```

Inside `_addUserWithdrawalRequest`, the nonce is pushed to the user's deque and the global `nextUnusedNonce` is incremented with no count check:

```solidity
// LRTWithdrawalManager.sol:756-757
userAssociatedNonces[asset][msg.sender].pushBack(nextUnusedNonce_);
nextUnusedNonce[asset] = nextUnusedNonce_ + 1;
```

The only guard against over-commitment is the asset-amount check:

```solidity
// LRTWithdrawalManager.sol:170
if (expectedAssetAmount > getAvailableAssetAmount(asset)) revert ExceedAmountToWithdraw();
```

This prevents committing more assets than exist, but it does **not** limit the number of individual requests. An attacker can split their rsETH into `totalAvailableAssets / minRsEthAmountToWithdraw` separate requests, each consuming the minimum amount, filling the entire available asset capacity with attacker-controlled queue entries.

The operator's `unlockQueue` processes entries sequentially in `_unlockWithdrawalRequests`:

```solidity
// LRTWithdrawalManager.sol:790-814
while (nextLockedNonce_ < firstExcludedIndex) {
    bytes32 requestId = getRequestId(asset, nextLockedNonce_);
    WithdrawalRequest storage request = withdrawalRequests[requestId];
    if (block.number < request.withdrawalStartBlock + withdrawalDelayBlocks) break;
    uint256 payoutAmount = _calculatePayoutAmount(request, rsETHPrice, assetPrice);
    if (availableAssetAmount < payoutAmount) break;
    ...
    unchecked { nextLockedNonce_++; }
}
```

The loop must advance through every attacker request before reaching legitimate users' requests. With thousands of entries, each iteration performing multiple storage reads/writes, the gas cost becomes unbounded.

By contrast, `KernelDepositPool` — another contract in the same repository — explicitly enforces `MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_USER = 100` and checks it on every `initiateWithdrawal` call:

```solidity
// KernelDepositPool.sol:38,323
uint256 public constant MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_USER = 100;
if (userWithdrawalIds[msg.sender].length >= maxNumberOfWithdrawalsPerUser) revert WithdrawalLimitReached();
```

`LRTWithdrawalManager` has no equivalent guard.

### Impact Explanation

**Temporary freezing of funds (Medium)**: While the attacker's requests occupy all committed asset capacity, `getAvailableAssetAmount(asset)` returns 0, causing every subsequent `initiateWithdrawal` call from legitimate users to revert with `ExceedAmountToWithdraw`. Legitimate users cannot queue withdrawals until the attacker's requests are processed and `assetsCommitted` decreases. The freeze lasts at least `withdrawalDelayBlocks` (default 8 days).

**Unbounded gas consumption (Medium)**: `_unlockWithdrawalRequests` iterates linearly over all queued entries. With a large number of attacker-created entries, the operator's `unlockQueue` transaction can exceed the block gas limit, making it impossible to advance `nextLockedNonce` past the attacker's entries in a single call and requiring many batched calls to drain the queue.

### Likelihood Explanation

The attacker must hold rsETH proportional to the total available assets and lock it for the withdrawal delay period (8 days). This is a real economic cost. However, the attack requires no special privileges — `initiateWithdrawal` is callable by any rsETH holder — and the mechanism is straightforward. A well-capitalised attacker (e.g., a competing protocol or a large rsETH holder) can execute this at any time the contract is unpaused.

### Recommendation

1. Introduce a per-user pending withdrawal request cap in `initiateWithdrawal`, analogous to `KernelDepositPool.MAX_WITHDRAWALS_PER_USER`:

```solidity
uint256 public maxPendingWithdrawalsPerUser; // e.g. 100

function initiateWithdrawal(...) external {
    ...
    if (userAssociatedNonces[asset][msg.sender].length() >= maxPendingWithdrawalsPerUser)
        revert TooManyPendingWithdrawals();
    ...
}
```

2. Optionally, add a global cap on `nextUnusedNonce - nextLockedNonce` (total pending requests per asset) to bound the queue depth independently of per-user limits.

### Proof of Concept

1. Protocol has 1000 ETH in available assets; `minRsEthAmountToWithdraw[ETH]` is set to `1e15` (0.001 ETH worth of rsETH).
2. Attacker acquires rsETH equivalent to 1000 ETH and calls `initiateWithdrawal(ETH, 1e15, "")` in a loop ~1,000,000 times (splitting across blocks as needed), each time committing 0.001 ETH of asset capacity.
3. After the attacker's requests fill `assetsCommitted[ETH] == totalAssets`, every subsequent call by a legitimate user reverts: `ExceedAmountToWithdraw`.
4. The operator calls `unlockQueue(ETH, nextUnusedNonce, ...)`. The `_unlockWithdrawalRequests` loop must iterate through all ~1,000,000 attacker entries before reaching any legitimate request, consuming gas far beyond the block limit.
5. Legitimate users' withdrawals are frozen for at least 8 days (the withdrawal delay) until the attacker's requests are drained through many batched `unlockQueue` calls. [1](#0-0) [2](#0-1) [3](#0-2) [4](#0-3) [5](#0-4)
