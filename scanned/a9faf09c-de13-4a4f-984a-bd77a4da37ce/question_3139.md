# Q3139: generate remote config url cross-context fee reuse via generateRemoteConfigUrl

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker abuse wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration with crafted `config`, `port`, or stale-state timing so that `generateRemoteConfigUrl` in `features/remote-config/module/generate-remote-config-url.ts` normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard, violating the invariant that cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: features/remote-config/module/generate-remote-config-url.ts::generateRemoteConfigUrl
- Entrypoint: wallet startup or resume path that loads persisted or fetched remote configuration
- Attacker controls: ETag or Last-Modified transitions combined with repeated load / update calls
- Exploit idea: normalize or merge configuration values in a way that silently widens behavior or disables a guard
- Invariant to test: cache validators must not prevent refresh when the effective security policy changed
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: load config for one network or account context, switch context, and ensure fee or policy data is not silently reused
