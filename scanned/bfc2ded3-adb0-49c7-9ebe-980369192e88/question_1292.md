# Q1292: price-multi-resolve via borrow: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `ft` trait principal reach `price-multi-resolve` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397) in a state where it count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? Given that it folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:397` -> `price-multi-resolve`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `price-multi-resolve` folds `iter-price-multi` into a POSITIONAL price list, asserting only the `valid` flag at the end. Reach it through `borrow` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `borrow` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `price-multi-resolve` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
