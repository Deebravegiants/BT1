# Q5632: accrue-user-debts via supply-collateral-add: record a repayment larger than the value actually delivere

## Question
Does `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) let an unprivileged attacker who controls `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg) reach `accrue-user-debts` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259) in a state where it record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered? Given that it folds accrual over the position's debt list only, the invariant that shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets` breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:259` -> `accrue-user-debts`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg)
- Exploit idea: `accrue-user-debts` folds accrual over the position's debt list only. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and record a repayment larger than the value actually delivered.
- Invariant to test: shares outstanding valued at the current share price never exceed `total-assets`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `supply-collateral-add` with `min-shares` (the only slippage bound on the deposit leg), and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
