# Q1183: add-user-collateral via supply-collateral-add: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`add-user-collateral` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198) adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Can an unprivileged caller of `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175), by choosing vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing direct theft of another user's collateral?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:198` -> `add-user-collateral`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg
- Exploit idea: `add-user-collateral` adds to the collateral row with a graceful u0 default. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: In `local-testing/tests` on a local fork, drive `supply-collateral-add` with vault share price at the moment of the deposit leg, then read `add-user-collateral` state before and after in the same block and assert the two sides of the invariant are equal.
