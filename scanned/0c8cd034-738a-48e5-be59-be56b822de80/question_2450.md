# Q2450: serialized_error — host header split from connection host via response-driven retry

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error` through `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers while supplying a 429 or 500 response with a chosen `retry-after` header, steering the retry loop, so that when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: a 429 or 500 response with a chosen `retry-after` header, steering the retry loop
- Exploit idea: when `api_host` is set, `Host` is `session.shop` while the socket goes to `api_host`, so the two identities diverge
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
