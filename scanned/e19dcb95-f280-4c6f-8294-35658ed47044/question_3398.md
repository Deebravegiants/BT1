# Q3398: factory deployment: front-run HinkalFactoryDeployer's SAFE_S [when the attacker sandwiches t]

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker front-run HinkalFactoryDeployer's SAFE_SINGLETON_FACTORY create2 with a matching salt to squat the address, to hijack the deterministic Hinkal address, deploy attacker bytecode at it, or permanently block the intended deployment, specifically when the attacker sandwiches the tx with their own deposit and withdraw (where surrounding state is attacker-tuned)?

## Target
- File/function: contracts/HinkalFactory.sol :: deployHinkal / appendBytecodeChunk / HinkalFactoryDeployer
- Entrypoint: HinkalFactoryDeployer constructor / HinkalFactory (pre-ownership)
- Attacker controls: create2 salt via SAFE_SINGLETON_FACTORY, deployment ordering (only if reachable pre-owner)
- Exploit idea: race or corrupt the deterministic deployment before ownership is settled
- Invariant to test: the code at the deterministic Hinkal address == the audited Hinkal bytecode
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical: permanent freezing of user funds
- Fast validation: Foundry: simulate the create2 race/hash mismatch, assert wrong code or blocked deploy
