# Q206: host_name — version becomes a path via thread-local session

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread to `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`, does `Context.host_name` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.host_name`
- Entrypoint: `host_name` / `host_scheme`, which parse `Context.host` (defaulted from `ENV['HOST']`) with `URI`
- Attacker controls: the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread
- Exploit idea: `api_version.gsub("-","_")` is concatenated into a filesystem path before `Dir.exist?`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a crafted `api_version` cannot make `load_rest_resources` touch a path outside `lib/shopify_api/rest/resources`
