# Q3862: strobe transcript encode_array_len_as_u32 the same logical data

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `public governance call path (propose_update / vote_update / vote_new_parameters / vote_add_domains / start_keygen_instance / start_reshare_instance)` and use proposal contents, vote/removal timing, participant-churn timing, repeated calls, and any public arguments accepted by the method to drive the code path through `crates/threshold-signatures/src/crypto/proofs/strobe_transcript.rs::encode_array_len_as_u32` so that the same logical data changes meaning across modules, breaking the invariant that ordering-sensitive security logic must use one canonical participant, vote, or provider ordering, and leading to Balance manipulation?

## Target
- File/function: crates/threshold-signatures/src/crypto/proofs/strobe_transcript.rs:7::encode_array_len_as_u32
- Entrypoint: `public governance call path (propose_update / vote_update / vote_new_parameters / vote_add_domains / start_keygen_instance / start_reshare_instance)`
- Attacker controls: proposal contents, vote/removal timing, participant-churn timing, repeated calls, and any public arguments accepted by the method
- Exploit idea: the same logical data changes meaning across modules
- Invariant to test: ordering-sensitive security logic must use one canonical participant, vote, or provider ordering
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: permute attacker-controlled collections before and after conversion boundaries and compare the resulting hashes, thresholds, or routing choices
