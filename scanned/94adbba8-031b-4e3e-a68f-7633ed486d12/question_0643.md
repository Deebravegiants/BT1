# Q643: auth fallback-auth weakness via load

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use mobile unlock or approval flow that invokes PIN/biometric authentication with attacker-controlled `port`, `config`, and transition timing so that `load` in `features/auth-mobile/module/auth.js` create a stale cross-wallet binding between account metadata and the active seed after import or clear, violating the rule that repeated lifecycle calls must be idempotent with respect to seed custody and account scoping, and ultimately reaching `Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/auth-mobile/module/auth.js::load
- Entrypoint: mobile unlock or approval flow that invokes PIN/biometric authentication
- Attacker controls: a PIN/biometric fallback path and the order of user-visible approval steps
- Exploit idea: create a stale cross-wallet binding between account metadata and the active seed after import or clear
- Invariant to test: repeated lifecycle calls must be idempotent with respect to seed custody and account scoping
- Expected Immunefi impact: Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds
- Fast validation: unit-test hook ordering and ensure no event fires with unlocked or imported state before validation and persistence complete
