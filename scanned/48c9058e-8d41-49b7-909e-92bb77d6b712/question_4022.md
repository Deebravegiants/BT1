# Q4022: create via supply-collateral-add: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Entering through `supply-collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175) while controlling `amount`, can an unprivileged attacker make `create` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150) destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding protocol insolvency.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:150` -> `create`
- Entrypoint: `supply-collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1175`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `create` binds a principal to a fresh numeric id. Reach it through `supply-collateral-add` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `supply-collateral-add` twice with `amount` varied, and assert that the value `create` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
