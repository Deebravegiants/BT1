# Q1287: mask-to-list-iter via liquidate-multi: leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects

## Question
`mask-to-list-iter` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440) appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-multi` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593), by choosing the trait principals supplied per entry, use that to leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects, violating the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:440` -> `mask-to-list-iter`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-multi` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1593`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the trait principals supplied per entry
- Exploit idea: `mask-to-list-iter` appends under `(unwrap-panic (as-max-len? ... u64))`, aborting if the position exceeds the bound. Reach it through `liquidate-multi` and leave a residue that no reconciliation pass ever inspects.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `mask-to-list-iter` touches, run `liquidate-multi` with the trait principals supplied per entry, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
