# Q2449: offline_session_id — fallback weakens the strong path via empty token

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an empty or whitespace `shopify_id_token`, exercising the `MissingJwtTokenError` boundary versus the cookie fallback at `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation, makes `SessionUtils.offline_session_id` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.offline_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `offline_session_id(shop)`, a bare `"offline_#{shop}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: an empty or whitespace `shopify_id_token`, exercising the `MissingJwtTokenError` boundary versus the cookie fallback
- Exploit idea: an embedded app that would otherwise require a signed id token accepts a cookie whenever the header is absent
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
