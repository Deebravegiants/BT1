# Q4005: set_property — query forwarded verbatim via has_many element class

## Question
Starting from `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, can an unprivileged attacker supply the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated so that `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Rest::Base#set_property`, and whether the result reaches High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated
- Exploit idea: `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
