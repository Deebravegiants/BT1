# Q4394: get_path_ids — template selection is textual via response-driven attribute names

## Question
Trace `Rest::Base.get_path_ids` from `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires with attribute names arriving in API response JSON, which become `public_send("#{attribute}=")` and `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}")` targets: because `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path_ids`
- Entrypoint: `get_path_ids`, which enumerates the id placeholders a path template requires
- Attacker controls: attribute names arriving in API response JSON, which become `public_send("#{attribute}=")` and `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}")` targets
- Exploit idea: `get_path` picks a template by matching available ids, so a crafted `ids` hash selects a different template than intended
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `params:` values are query-escaped in the recorded request and cannot introduce a second query or a fragment
