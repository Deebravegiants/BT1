# Q625: save — dynamic dispatch on response data via has_many element class

## Question
Does `Rest::Base#save` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated at `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`? Show that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#save`
- Entrypoint: `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`
- Attacker controls: the element class resolved for a `has_many` attribute from response data, which decides how nested payloads are instantiated
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: stub a response whose JSON keys collide with internal methods and assert `create_instance` cannot overwrite the instance's session or client
