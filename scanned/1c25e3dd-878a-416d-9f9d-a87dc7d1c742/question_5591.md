# Q5591: calc-treasury-lp-preview via deposit: make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree 

## Question
`calc-treasury-lp-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350) divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Can an unprivileged caller of `deposit` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763), by choosing `amount`, use that to make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount, violating the invariant that `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:350` -> `calc-treasury-lp-preview`
- Entrypoint: `deposit` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:763`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `calc-treasury-lp-preview` divides by `(- ta-preview reserve-inc)`, a denominator that can reach zero or underflow. Reach it through `deposit` and make the per-user ledger and the vault aggregate disagree by a repeatable amount.
- Invariant to test: `principal-scaled` and `total-borrowed` describe the same outstanding principal
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `deposit` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
