# Q5058: save — cursor trusted via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
Can nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`, make `Rest::Base#save` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#save`
- Entrypoint: `save(update_object:)`, which chooses verb and path via `deduce_write_verb` and `deduce_write_path`
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: page-info cursors from a response are replayed into the next authenticated request without validation
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
