# Q2651: find-asset via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`find-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584) returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `amount`, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt` and producing protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:584` -> `find-asset`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `find-asset` returns `none` when the id is absent, and several callers resolve that with `unwrap-panic`. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: the sum over users of the market-vault `debt` map times `index` equals the vault's `total-debt`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
