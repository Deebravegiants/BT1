# Q3924: make_request — path built by interpolation via path prefix admin/

## Question
Can a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`, make `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host? The binding to test is CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: a `path` beginning with `admin/`, which bypasses the `/admin/api/<version>` base path entirely
- Exploit idea: resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `get(path: 'admin/oauth/access_token')` and assert the recorded URI, then assert the access token was not sent to it
