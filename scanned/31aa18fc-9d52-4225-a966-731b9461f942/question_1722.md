# Q1722: request_url — caller headers win via resource id injection

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url` through the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/` while supplying an id segment taken from user input, e.g. `orders/#{params[:id]}` where the id contains `/` or `?`, so that `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, which strips a leading `/` and a trailing `.json`, re-appends `.json`, and re-roots at `@base_uri` for any path starting with `admin/`
- Attacker controls: an id segment taken from user input, e.g. `orders/#{params[:id]}` where the id contains `/` or `?`
- Exploit idea: `extra_headers` merges last inside `HttpClient#request`, overriding security-relevant defaults
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call `get(path: 'admin/oauth/access_token')` and assert the recorded URI, then assert the access token was not sent to it
