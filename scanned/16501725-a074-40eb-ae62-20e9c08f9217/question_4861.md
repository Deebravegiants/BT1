# Q4861: shop — claim trusted as identity via sid claim

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity to `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`, does `JwtPayload#shop` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app? Close the question on SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#shop`
- Entrypoint: `JwtPayload#shop`, computed as `@dest.gsub("https://", "")`
- Attacker controls: the optional `sid` claim, which identifies the Shopify-side session and is stored but never used to bind the derived identity
- Exploit idea: a claim is trusted to identify a tenant even though the signing secret is shared across every shop that installed the app
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
