# Q5049: sanitize_shop_domain — dev-domain entries reachable in production via caller-supplied myshopify_domain

## Question
Does `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call at a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`? Show that `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties, that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Entrypoint: a host-app route that forwards a user-supplied `shop` query parameter into `ShopifyAPI::Utils::ShopValidator.sanitize_shop_domain`
- Attacker controls: a request that reaches a code path where `myshopify_domain:` is derived from user input, widening `trusted_domains` for that call
- Exploit idea: `spin.dev` and `shop.dev` remain in `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS` in production builds and are registrable by third parties
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
