# Q4325: begin_auth — shop reaches HttpClient unvalidated via private/embedded config

## Question
Is there a reachable state in which an unprivileged attacker, controlling an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, makes `Oauth.begin_auth` return a result the caller treats as authenticated, given that `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`? Test SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and quantify Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: an app configured with `is_embedded: false`, where the callback returns a cookie whose value is `session.id` itself
- Exploit idea: `Session.new(shop: auth_query.shop)` becomes `@base_uri = "https://#{session.shop}"` for the POST that carries `client_id` and `client_secret`
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
