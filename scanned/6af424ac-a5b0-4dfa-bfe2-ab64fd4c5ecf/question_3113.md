# Q3113: session_id_from_shopify_id_token — key is predictable via guessed online key

## Question
Trace `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token` from `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims with a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint: because `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.session_id_from_shopify_id_token`
- Entrypoint: `session_id_from_shopify_id_token(id_token:, online:)`, which builds the storage key from JWT claims
- Attacker controls: a cookie set to `<victim>.myshopify.com_<user id>`, matching what `jwt_session_id` would mint
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: fuzz shop/sub pairs containing `_` and assert `jwt_session_id` is injective
