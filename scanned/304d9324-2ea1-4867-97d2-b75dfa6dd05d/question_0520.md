# Q520: initialize — no vocabulary validation via case variance

## Question
Does `Auth::AuthScopes#initialize` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits scope names differing only in case, since comparison is exact string set membership at `AuthScopes.new(scope_names)`, which splits a string on `,` with no token validation? Show that any string is accepted as a scope, so a scope check can be satisfied by a name Shopify never issued, that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/auth_scopes.rb` -> `Auth::AuthScopes#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `AuthScopes.new(scope_names)`, which splits a string on `,` with no token validation
- Attacker controls: scope names differing only in case, since comparison is exact string set membership
- Exploit idea: any string is accepted as a scope, so a scope check can be satisfied by a name Shopify never issued
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `AuthScopes.new('write_x').covers?(AuthScopes.new('read_x'))` cannot be reached with a fabricated `x`
