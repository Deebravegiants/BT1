# Q19: lib verify_foreign_transaction the contract returns a

## Question
Can an unprivileged NEAR account enter through `verify_foreign_transaction` and use the chosen chain/domain, transaction identifier, proof bytes, event/log shape, repeated submissions, and replay timing to drive the code path through `crates/contract/src/lib.rs::verify_foreign_transaction` so that the contract returns a valid signature to the wrong logical request owner, breaking the invariant that callback resolution must stay bound to the original predecessor, path, payload, domain, and request kind, and leading to Unauthorized transaction?

## Target
- File/function: crates/contract/src/lib.rs:519::verify_foreign_transaction
- Entrypoint: `verify_foreign_transaction`
- Attacker controls: the chosen chain/domain, transaction identifier, proof bytes, event/log shape, repeated submissions, and replay timing
- Exploit idea: the contract returns a valid signature to the wrong logical request owner
- Invariant to test: callback resolution must stay bound to the original predecessor, path, payload, domain, and request kind
- Expected Immunefi impact: Unauthorized transaction
- Fast validation: submit overlapping requests that share most fields but differ in one authority-bearing field and inspect which callback receives the completion
