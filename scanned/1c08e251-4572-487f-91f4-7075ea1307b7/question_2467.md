# Q2467: temp — temp restores unconditionally via concurrent temp

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session to `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block, does `Auth::Session.temp` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.temp`
- Entrypoint: `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block
- Attacker controls: overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session
- Exploit idea: the `ensure` block restores whatever was captured, which under nesting or threading may not be the caller's session
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `expired?` is true, not false, for a session with no expiry once its token is past any plausible lifetime
