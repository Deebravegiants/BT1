# Q1268: make_request — path built by interpolation via tries argument

## Question
Starting from the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `tries:` value that lengthens the retry loop around an authenticated request so that resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#make_request`
- Entrypoint: the private `make_request`, which sets `body_type` from whether `body` is nil and forwards `headers` as `extra_headers`
- Attacker controls: a `tries:` value that lengthens the retry loop around an authenticated request
- Exploit idea: resource ids are concatenated into the path with no escaping, so a crafted id changes the resource or the host
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a user-supplied resource id containing `/`, `?` or `#` cannot change the recorded request path beyond one segment
