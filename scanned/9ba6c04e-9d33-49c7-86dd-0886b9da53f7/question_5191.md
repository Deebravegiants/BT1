# Q5191: decode_token — shop never domain-validated via missing claims

## Question
Can a token omitting `sid`, `jti` or `sub`, exercising the `T.let(..., T.nilable(String))` paths, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`, make `JwtPayload#decode_token` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: a token omitting `sid`, `jti` or `sub`, exercising the `T.let(..., T.nilable(String))` paths
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop` string is used as a request host and a session key without `ShopValidator`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
