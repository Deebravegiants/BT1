# Q4609: decode_token — separator collision via Bearer prefix games

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix to the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`, does `JwtPayload#decode_token` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter? Close the question on SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key` and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#decode_token`
- Entrypoint: the private `decode_token`, a `JWT.decode(token, secret, true, leeway: 10, algorithm: 'HS256')`
- Attacker controls: an `Authorization` value where `gsub("Bearer ", "")` in `SessionUtils` removes an interior occurrence, not just the prefix
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `JwtPayload.new` raises for a `dest` outside `TRUSTED_SHOPIFY_DOMAINS`; if it does not, assert the resulting `HttpClient` base URI under WebMock
