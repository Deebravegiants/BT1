# Q0364: oracle-price-legal via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
Does `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the `price-feeds` buffers reach `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) in a state where it destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore? Given that it accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset breaks and the result is direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `borrow` with the `price-feeds` buffers, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
