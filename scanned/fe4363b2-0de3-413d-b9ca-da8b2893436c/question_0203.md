# Q203: index payload-view mismatch via cachedSodiumEncryptorRpc

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `cachedSodiumEncryptorRpc` in `sdks/headless/src/features/cached-sodium-encryptor-rpc/index.js` through wallet RPC call that asks the SDK to decrypt or unlock persisted wallet material and supply crafted `port`, `port`, and `port` values that trick the signing path into validating one payload view while signing another payload semantics, violating the invariant that externally supplied key material must never inherit trust or authorization from a different account context, and causing `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: sdks/headless/src/features/cached-sodium-encryptor-rpc/index.js::cachedSodiumEncryptorRpc
- Entrypoint: wallet RPC call that asks the SDK to decrypt or unlock persisted wallet material
- Attacker controls: a chain-specific signing request whose visible fields differ from the actually signed bytes
- Exploit idea: trick the signing path into validating one payload view while signing another payload semantics
- Invariant to test: externally supplied key material must never inherit trust or authorization from a different account context
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: fuzz derivation-path and key-identifier inputs and assert the returned key scope never exceeds the approved request
