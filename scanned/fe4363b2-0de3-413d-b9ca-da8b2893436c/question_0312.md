# Q312: index fail-open bridge parsing via createUiRpc

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker enter through connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge and control `name`, `method`, and `port` so that `createUiRpc` in `libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/index.js` carry pre-approval, unlocked, or imported-seed state across a boundary that should reset it, breaking the invariant that malformed RPC payloads must fail closed and never select state-changing defaults, and leading to `Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user`?

## Target
- File/function: libraries/browser-extension-rpc/src/index.js::createUiRpc
- Entrypoint: connected website RPC request handled by the wallet bridge
- Attacker controls: a metadata-bearing request plus disconnect/reconnect timing from the same browser session
- Exploit idea: carry pre-approval, unlocked, or imported-seed state across a boundary that should reset it
- Invariant to test: malformed RPC payloads must fail closed and never select state-changing defaults
- Expected Immunefi impact: Taking state-modifying authenticated actions on behalf of other users without any interaction by that user
- Fast validation: unit-test reconnect/disconnect races and assert no stale approval, unlock, or import state is reused
