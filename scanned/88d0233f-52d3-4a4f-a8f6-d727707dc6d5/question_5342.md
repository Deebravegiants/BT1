# Q5342: calculate-asset-notional-value via collateral-add: count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims

## Question
Entering through `collateral-add` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020) while controlling the `ft` trait principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `calculate-asset-notional-value` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544) count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims? `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold, so the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned would fail, yielding protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:544` -> `calculate-asset-notional-value`
- Entrypoint: `collateral-add` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1020`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `ft` trait principal
- Exploit idea: `calculate-asset-notional-value` normalizes collateral with round-down and debt with round-up, and calls `accrue-and-cache` with `unwrap-panic` inside the fold. Reach it through `collateral-add` and count one deposit as backing for two simultaneous claims.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `collateral-add` twice with the `ft` trait principal varied, and assert that the value `calculate-asset-notional-value` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
