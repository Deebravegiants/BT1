# Q5744: shopify_header — no replay protection via own-shop signed body

## Question
Can a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`, make `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that no nonce, timestamp or delivery-id tracking bounds re-delivery of a signed body? The binding to test is SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#shopify_header`
- Entrypoint: the private `shopify_header`, which prefers `shopify-<name>` over `x-shopify-<name>`
- Attacker controls: a body validly signed for the attacker's own shop and replayed with different headers
- Exploit idea: no nonce, timestamp or delivery-id tracking bounds re-delivery of a signed body
- Invariant to test: SIGNATURE COVERAGE: every value acted on downstream is inside the string handed to `HmacValidator` via `to_signable_string`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: sign one body with the test secret, POST it twice with different `x-shopify-shop-domain` values, assert the handler receives two different shops for one signature
