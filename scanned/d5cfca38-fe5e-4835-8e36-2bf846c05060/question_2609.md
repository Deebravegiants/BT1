# Q2609: Cross-user order dependence via unstake_all under two account same epoch dust threshold

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker use `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::unstake_all()` while a victim position is already live, and by choosing the exact public-call order under all attacker-visible steps happen in the same epoch before any natural reward settlement and dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding, make the victim and attacker end with different total claimable value than they would under the economically equivalent fair ordering?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::unstake_all` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::inner_unstake` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping`, `internal_stake`, `inner_unstake`, and per-account share accounting
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::unstake_all()`
- Attacker controls: existing share balance, total-share state, reward timing, and whether the full exit leaves residual dust or excess liquid value; two attacker EOAs alternating calls to compare split and merged positions; all attacker-visible steps happen in the same epoch before any natural reward settlement; dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding
- Exploit idea: Treat public call ordering itself as the attack surface: attacker and victim both use valid public functions, but the attacker chooses when `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::unstake_all()` triggers accounting transitions.
- Invariant to test: When total stake, rewards, and withdrawals are economically equivalent, user value split should not depend on attacker-chosen ordering beyond legitimate time-at-risk differences.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Balance manipulation
- Fast validation: Differential test two traces with identical actors and balances but swapped attacker/victim ordering around `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::unstake_all()`; assert equivalent final economics unless time-at-risk legitimately differs.
