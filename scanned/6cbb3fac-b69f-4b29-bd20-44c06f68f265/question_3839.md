# Q3839: Public-call brick via ping under helper contract ping heavy dust threshold

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker compose valid public calls around `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping()` with an attacker-owned helper contract plus an attacker EOA coordinating calls and deposits and a third party or attacker-owned helper repeatedly inserts public `ping()` calls between every economic step, so the pool reaches a state where `internal_ping()` or a later public method reliably panics on invariant checks and honest users can no longer settle rewards, unstake, or withdraw?

## Target
- File/function: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping` with `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping` and reward distribution into `total_staked_balance` / `total_stake_shares` plus `staking-pool/src/internal.rs::internal_ping`, `last_total_balance`, `total_staked_balance`, and assertion-based state transitions
- Entrypoint: `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping()`
- Attacker controls: when `ping()` is triggered, how often it is repeated, what attacker position exists before it, and whether a victim position is already live; an attacker-owned helper contract plus an attacker EOA coordinating calls and deposits; a third party or attacker-owned helper repeatedly inserts public `ping()` calls between every economic step; dust-sized values near the smallest amount that still mints nonzero shares or changes rounding
- Exploit idea: Look for a sequence where user-triggered accounting deltas make a later assertion on `last_total_balance`, total shares, or total stake unsatisfiable without privileged repair.
- Invariant to test: Any state reachable solely through valid public methods must remain serviceable by later valid public methods and must not permanently freeze user funds.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Contracts execution flows
- Fast validation: Stateful fuzzing over all public user calls with `staking-pool/src/lib.rs::ping()` emphasized; stop on any sequence that causes all future `ping()/unstake()/withdraw()` attempts to panic.
