# Q2567: send-tokens via borrow: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`send-tokens` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259) pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Can an unprivileged caller of `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238), by choosing `amount`, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing protocol insolvency?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:259` -> `send-tokens`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `amount`
- Exploit idea: `send-tokens` pushes an asset to a caller-chosen recipient principal. Reach it through `borrow` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency
- Fast validation: Run the baseline `borrow` call, then the attacker-shaped one with `amount`, and assert the attacker's net token balance change is zero or negative.
