# Q1169: unified_admin? — parse/resolve divergence via empty path segment

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` through the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin` while supplying a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant, so that what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a unified-admin URL whose path ends in a slash or is empty, so `path.split('/').last` yields `nil` or the literal store name of another merchant
- Exploit idea: what `Addressable::URI` reports as `host`/`domain` differs from the authority HTTParty finally connects to
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's refresh token, granting durable access after rotation (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven minitest asserting `sanitize_shop_domain` returns `nil` for the candidate string, then assert the same string through `URI`/HTTParty resolves elsewhere
