# Q2322: oracle-price-legal via borrow: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling `receiver`, including a contract principal, can an unprivileged attacker make `oracle-price-legal` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band, so the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:362` -> `oracle-price-legal`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: `receiver`, including a contract principal
- Exploit idea: `oracle-price-legal` accepts any price strictly greater than zero, with no upper bound and no sanity band. Reach it through `borrow` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz `receiver`, including a contract principal across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `oracle-price-legal` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
