# Q1022: admin_session_token? — separator collision via iss/dest mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?` through `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check while supplying a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares, so that the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter, breaking the requirement that CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#admin_session_token?`
- Entrypoint: `admin_session_token?`, a bare `@iss.end_with?("/admin")` check
- Attacker controls: a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares
- Exploit idea: the derived `shop`/`sub` values contain the `_` that `jwt_session_id` uses as its delimiter
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
