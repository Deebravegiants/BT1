# Q3223: cookie_session_id — unauthenticated bytes become the key via cookie plus token

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops to `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key, does `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a request presenting both a cookie and an id token with conflicting shops
- Exploit idea: the cookie value is returned as the session id with no MAC, no signature and no shop binding
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert an embedded app rejects a request with no `Authorization` header rather than falling back to the cookie
