# Q1749: is_zero_lamport arithmetic overflows on reachable values (stake_rewards.rs)

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker entering through ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for reach `is_zero_lamport` in `accounts-db/src/stake_rewards.rs` with an account whose data length changes between the check and the use, and make the arithmetic in `is_zero_lamport` overflow, wrap, or divide by zero, so that the invariant "All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded." breaks and the result is Liveness / Loss of Availability?

## Target
- File/function: `accounts-db/src/stake_rewards.rs` -> `is_zero_lamport()` (around line 36)
- Entrypoint: ordinary transactions that create, write, resize, close and reopen accounts the attacker pays for
- Attacker controls: an account whose data length changes between the check and the use
- Exploit idea: Supply values that make `is_zero_lamport` overflow, so debug builds abort and release builds wrap into a nonsensical accounting value.
- Invariant to test: All arithmetic on attacker-controlled values is checked or provably bounded.
- Expected Immunefi impact: Liveness / Loss of Availability - consensus halts and requires human intervention (1,250-5,000 SOL)
- Fast validation: Proptest `is_zero_lamport` across full integer ranges; assert checked arithmetic and no wrap in release mode.

## Bounty scope note
In-scope target per anza-xyz/agave SECURITY.md. Assumes no validator, leader,
staked-node, peer, gossip, operator, or leaked-key capability. Folder scope:
Critical. An unprivileged attacker can send a valid-looking transaction that panics, overflows, aborts, or wedges banking/replay on every node, halting consensus until human intervention.
