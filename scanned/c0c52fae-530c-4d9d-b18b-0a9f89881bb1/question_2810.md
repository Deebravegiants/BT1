# Q2810: copy_attributes_from — nil means valid via associated_user id

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id to `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id`, does `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#copy_attributes_from`
- Entrypoint: `copy_attributes_from(other)`, which overwrites every attribute except `id`
- Attacker controls: the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id
- Exploit idea: `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
