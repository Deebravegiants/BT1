# Q2793: cookie_session_id — key is predictable via shop with underscore

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id` through `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key while supplying a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key, so that `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information, breaking the requirement that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host, and ending in Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/session_utils.rb` -> `SessionUtils.cookie_session_id`
- Entrypoint: `cookie_session_id`, which returns `cookies['shopify_app_session']` verbatim as the storage key
- Attacker controls: a shop or `sub` value containing `_` so two distinct (shop, user) pairs map to one key
- Exploit idea: `offline_#{shop}` and `#{shop}_#{user_id}` are fully derivable from public information
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest: call `current_session_id(nil, {'shopify_app_session' => 'offline_victim.myshopify.com'}, false)` and assert the returned key is not accepted as an identity
