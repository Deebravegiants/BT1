# Q2513: initialize — leeway on both ends via iss/dest mismatch

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `JwtPayload#initialize` through `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header while supplying a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares, so that a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries, breaking the requirement that SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`, and ending in Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/jwt_payload.rb` -> `JwtPayload#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::JwtPayload.new(token)`, reached from every embedded request carrying an `Authorization: Bearer <id_token>` header
- Attacker controls: a token whose `iss` and `dest` claims name different shops, which the constructor never compares
- Exploit idea: a symmetric 10-second leeway is applied to `exp` and `nbf`, widening the replay window at both boundaries
- Invariant to test: SESSION DERIVATION: a session id is derived only from bytes authenticated under `Context.api_secret_key`
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: craft `sub` values containing `_` and assert `SessionUtils.jwt_session_id` cannot be made to collide across users
