# Q3729: auth_base_uri — private-app guard ordering via attacker-signed callback

## Question
Trace `Oauth.auth_base_uri` from the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator` with a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app: because `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and map it to Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.auth_base_uri`
- Entrypoint: the private `auth_base_uri(shop)` that builds `"https://#{shop}/admin"` with no call to `ShopValidator`
- Attacker controls: a full OAuth callback that Shopify validly signed for the attacker's own development shop, replayed against the victim app
- Exploit idea: `Context.private?` and `Context.setup?` are checked around, not before, the value that decides the outbound host
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert_requested the `/admin/oauth/access_token` POST and check its host equals the shop the browser began with, not the shop in the callback
