# Q4316: total-supply-preview via redeem: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Does `redeem` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797) let an unprivileged attacker who controls the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance reach `total-supply-preview` (mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363) in a state where it mint shares whose backing was never received? Given that it adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against, the invariant that every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit breaks and the result is protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:363` -> `total-supply-preview`
- Entrypoint: `redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/vault/v0-vault-stx.clar:797`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance
- Exploit idea: `total-supply-preview` adds the not-yet-minted `calc-treasury-lp-preview` to the live supply that both conversions price against. Reach it through `redeem` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: every round-up has a paired round-down that repetition cannot exploit
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - protocol insolvency through uncollateralised debt
- Fast validation: Write a Clarinet simnet test calling `redeem` twice with the gap between the `assets` var and the real balance varied, and assert that the value `total-supply-preview` returns is identical in both runs; a divergence confirms the finding.
