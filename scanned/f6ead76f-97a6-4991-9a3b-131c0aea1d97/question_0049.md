# Q49: initialize — path built by concatenation via response_as_struct

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::Graphql::Client#initialize` through `Graphql::Client.new(session:, base_path:, api_version:)` and its version-override branch while supplying the `response_as_struct` flag, which re-parses the body into `OpenStruct` objects, so that `"#{@api_version}/graphql.json#{search_params}"` is textual, so a crafted version or flag reshapes the URL, breaking the requirement that AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/graphql/client.rb` -> `Clients::Graphql::Client#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Graphql::Client.new(session:, base_path:, api_version:)` and its version-override branch
- Attacker controls: the `response_as_struct` flag, which re-parses the body into `OpenStruct` objects
- Exploit idea: `"#{@api_version}/graphql.json#{search_params}"` is textual, so a crafted version or flag reshapes the URL
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `headers:` cannot override `X-Shopify-Access-Token` in the recorded request
