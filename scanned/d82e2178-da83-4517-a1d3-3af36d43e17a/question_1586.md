# Q1586: cached sodium encryptor external key rebinding via createCachedSodiumEncryptor

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `createCachedSodiumEncryptor` in `features/cached-sodium-encryptor/module/cached-sodium-encryptor.ts` through signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action and supply crafted `seedId`, `privateKey`, and `params` values that widen a derivation or export scope so a narrower approved request yields broader key material, violating the invariant that locked state must prevent all operations that derive, export, decrypt, or sign with key material, and causing `Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds`?

## Target
- File/function: features/cached-sodium-encryptor/module/cached-sodium-encryptor.ts::createCachedSodiumEncryptor
- Entrypoint: signing or key-export flow triggered by a connected dapp or standard wallet action
- Attacker controls: the order of lock/unlock, export, and sign requests around cached decrypted state
- Exploit idea: widen a derivation or export scope so a narrower approved request yields broader key material
- Invariant to test: locked state must prevent all operations that derive, export, decrypt, or sign with key material
- Expected Immunefi impact: Private key or private key generation leakage leading to unauthorized access to user funds
- Fast validation: construct a payload whose displayed fields and serialized bytes can diverge and assert the signer rejects or canonicalizes it safely
