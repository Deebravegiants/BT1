# Q5127: request_url — response content into logs via deprecation header

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim to the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, does `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: an `x-shopify-api-deprecated-reason` response header, which is logged verbatim
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the raised `HttpResponseError` message contains no access token, `client_secret` or `Authorization` value
