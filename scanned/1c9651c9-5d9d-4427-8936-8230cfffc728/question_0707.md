# Q707: topic — signature covers body only via body byte variance

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Webhooks::Request#topic` through `Request#topic`, reading the unsigned `shopify-topic` / `x-shopify-topic` header while supplying a raw body whose bytes differ from what the framework hands to `JSON.parse` (encoding conversion, BOM, trailing newline, rewound stream), so that `to_signable_string` returns `@raw_body`, so topic, shop, api-version and webhook-id are unauthenticated input travelling with a valid HMAC, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/webhooks/request.rb` -> `Webhooks::Request#topic`
- Entrypoint: `Request#topic`, reading the unsigned `shopify-topic` / `x-shopify-topic` header
- Attacker controls: a raw body whose bytes differ from what the framework hands to `JSON.parse` (encoding conversion, BOM, trailing newline, rewound stream)
- Exploit idea: `to_signable_string` returns `@raw_body`, so topic, shop, api-version and webhook-id are unauthenticated input travelling with a valid HMAC
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: register two handlers, replay one signed body under each topic header, and assert only the signed topic is dispatched
