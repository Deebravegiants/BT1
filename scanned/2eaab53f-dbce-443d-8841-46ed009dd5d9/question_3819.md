# Q3819: validate_auth_callback — state compared with == via unsanitised shop param

## Question
Can the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route, make `Oauth.validate_auth_callback` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that `state == auth_query.state` is a plain string comparison of a value the attacker can also observe or set? The binding to test is AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right; the impact to prove is Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.validate_auth_callback`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.validate_auth_callback(cookies:, auth_query:)`, reached from the app's public OAuth callback route
- Attacker controls: the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Exploit idea: `state == auth_query.state` is a plain string comparison of a value the attacker can also observe or set
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - authentication bypass: a forged or unsigned request is accepted as authentic by the app (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert the returned `SessionCookie#value` is never equal to `session.id` for an embedded app, and that the cookie is cleared
