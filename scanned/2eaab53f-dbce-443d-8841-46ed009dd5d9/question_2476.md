# Q2476: serialized_error — response content into logs via empty access token

## Question
Trace `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error` from `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers with a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response: because response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and map it to High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#serialized_error`
- Entrypoint: `serialized_error`, which builds an error message from response body and headers
- Attacker controls: a session whose `access_token` is empty or whitespace, so the `X-Shopify-Access-Token` header is skipped and an unauthenticated request is issued that still returns a 200-shaped response
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: issue a request with a crafted `path` and assert the recorded request URI's host equals `session.shop`
