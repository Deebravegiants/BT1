# Q2662: refresh via liquidate: have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that 

## Question
Entering through `liquidate` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382) while controlling the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, can an unprivileged attacker make `refresh` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171) have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently? `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write, so the invariant that tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset would fail, yielding direct theft of another user's collateral.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:171` -> `refresh`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1382`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering
- Exploit idea: `refresh` rewrites `mask` and stamps `last-update` to `stacks-block-time` on every write. Reach it through `liquidate` and have the same quantity scaled twice by two contracts that round differently.
- Invariant to test: tokens held by .v0-market-vault equal the sum of its `collateral` map for that asset
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - direct theft of another user's collateral
- Fast validation: Set up the position in simnet, call `liquidate` with the `price-feeds` buffers and their ordering, and assert on the printed event plus the post-state that collateral, debt and share totals still reconcile.
