# Q2590: append_first_party_development_headers — response content into logs via error body content

## Question
Can an unprivileged attacker reach `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers` through `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev` while supplying a response body whose `errors`/`error_description` fields are echoed into the raised exception message, so that response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context, breaking the requirement that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source, and ending in Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`)?

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#append_first_party_development_headers`
- Entrypoint: `append_first_party_development_headers`, which rewrites `Host` and `x-forwarded-host` for `.my.shop.dev`
- Attacker controls: a response body whose `errors`/`error_description` fields are echoed into the raised exception message
- Exploit idea: response-controlled strings reach `Context.logger` and the exception message alongside request context
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
