# Q4315: expired? — identity built by interpolation via concurrent temp

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session to `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil, does `Auth::Session#expired?` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#expired?`
- Entrypoint: `expired?`, which returns false whenever `@expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: overlapping `Session.temp` blocks on threads sharing a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar` active session
- Exploit idea: session ids are string concatenations of values that may contain the delimiter
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `expired?` is true, not false, for a session with no expiry once its token is past any plausible lifetime
