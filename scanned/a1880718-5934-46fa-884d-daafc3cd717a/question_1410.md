# Q1410: begin_auth — cookie carries no shop via unsanitised shop param

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!` to `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`, does `Oauth.begin_auth` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap? Close the question on SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host and on Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code`.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/oauth.rb` -> `Oauth.begin_auth`
- Entrypoint: `ShopifyAPI::Auth::Oauth.begin_auth(shop:, redirect_path:, is_online:, scope_override:)`, reached from the app's install/login route with a user-supplied `shop`
- Attacker controls: the `shop` query parameter, which neither `begin_auth` nor `validate_auth_callback` passes through `ShopValidator.sanitize!`
- Exploit idea: `SessionCookie` holds only the nonce - not the shop, `is_online` flag or scope that `begin_auth` was called with, so the callback cannot detect a shop swap
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - exfiltration of the app's `client_secret` and/or the OAuth authorization `code` (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: replay the same signed `auth_query` twice and assert the second call raises rather than minting a second session
