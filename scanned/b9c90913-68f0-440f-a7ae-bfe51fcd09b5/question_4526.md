# Q4526: request_url — attacker-steered retry loop via request.path

## Question
Can the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation, make `Clients::HttpClient#request_url` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/http_client.rb` -> `Clients::HttpClient#request_url`
- Entrypoint: the protected `request_url`, a bare `"#{@base_uri_and_path}/#{request.path}"` interpolation
- Attacker controls: the `path` on `HttpRequest`, interpolated straight into the URL with no escaping
- Exploit idea: response headers decide how long and how often the authenticated request is repeated
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: High - SSRF: an authenticated request carrying the app's credentials is driven to an unintended host (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: issue two requests on one `HttpClient` and assert the second does not inherit headers merged by the first
