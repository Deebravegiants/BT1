# Q128: activate_session — rotation window unbounded via thread-local session

## Question
Does `Context.activate_session` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread at `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`? Show that nothing ever clears `old_api_secret_key`, that SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/context.rb` -> `Context.activate_session`
- Entrypoint: `Context.activate_session(session)` and `Context.active_session`, backed by a `Concurrent::ThreadLocalVar`
- Attacker controls: the active session under concurrency, where a request handler runs on a pooled thread
- Exploit idea: nothing ever clears `old_api_secret_key`
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert a crafted `api_version` cannot make `load_rest_resources` touch a path outside `lib/shopify_api/rest/resources`
