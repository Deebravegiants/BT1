# Q541: temp — copy preserves the key via copy across identities

## Question
Does `Auth::Session.temp` collapse two distinct identities into one when an unprivileged attacker submits a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id` at `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block? Show that `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant, that SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host is violated, and that the consequence is Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.temp`
- Entrypoint: `Session.temp(shop:, access_token:)`, which swaps `Context.active_session` around a block
- Attacker controls: a `copy_attributes_from` call that moves another shop's `shop` and `access_token` onto a session keeping its own `id`
- Exploit idea: `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant
- Invariant to test: SHOP BINDING: shop authenticated by the signature/JWT == shop interpolated into the session id == shop used as the request host
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `expired?` is true, not false, for a session with no expiry once its token is past any plausible lifetime
