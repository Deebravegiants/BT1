# Q2724: set_property — dynamic dispatch on response data via nested has_many/has_one

## Question
Starting from `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data, can an unprivileged attacker supply nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name so that `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list? Determine whether CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted still holds through `Rest::Base#set_property`, and whether the result reaches Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base#set_property`
- Entrypoint: `set_property(key, val)`, which performs `instance_variable_set("@#{clean_key}", val)` with a key taken from response data
- Attacker controls: nested objects whose class is resolved from the attribute name
- Exploit idea: `public_send` and `instance_variable_set` targets are derived from data returned by the upstream call, not from a fixed allow-list
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
