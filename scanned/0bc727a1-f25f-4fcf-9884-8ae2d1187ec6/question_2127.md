# Q2127: socialize-debt-asset via liquidate-redeem: destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation 

## Question
`socialize-debt-asset` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879) calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits. Can an unprivileged caller of `liquidate-redeem` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604), by choosing the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, use that to destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore, violating the invariant that value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned and producing permanent freezing of funds?

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:879` -> `socialize-debt-asset`
- Entrypoint: `liquidate-redeem` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1604`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed
- Exploit idea: `socialize-debt-asset` calls the vault write-down, then overwrites `index-cache` for the current timestamp mid-fold, and carries a `success` flag that short-circuits. Reach it through `liquidate-redeem` and destroy value through a truncation the opposite operation does not restore.
- Invariant to test: value leaving a call equals value entering plus value minted minus value burned
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of funds
- Fast validation: Snapshot every state variable `socialize-debt-asset` touches, run `liquidate-redeem` with the seized zToken amount that is immediately redeemed, recompute the invariant off-chain from the snapshot, and assert it matches the on-chain result.
