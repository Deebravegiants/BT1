# Q0162: mask-pos via borrow: mint shares whose backing was never received

## Question
Entering through `borrow` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238) while controlling the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let, can an unprivileged attacker make `mask-pos` (mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91) mint shares whose backing was never received? `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET, so the invariant that `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds would fail, yielding permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed.

## Target
- File/function: `mainnet/contracts/market/v0-market-vault.clar:91` -> `mask-pos`
- Entrypoint: `borrow` (`mainnet/contracts/market/v0-4-market.clar:1238`), unprivileged and publicly callable
- Attacker controls: the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let
- Exploit idea: `mask-pos` maps an asset id to a bit position, offsetting debt bits by DEBT-OFFSET. Reach it through `borrow` and mint shares whose backing was never received.
- Invariant to test: `assets` never exceeds the underlying the vault actually holds
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - permanent freezing of a position that can never be closed
- Fast validation: Fuzz the order of accrual versus price resolution inside the let across its boundary values through `borrow` in simnet and assert `mask-pos` never returns a value that breaks the invariant.
