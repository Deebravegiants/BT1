# Q1991: from — nil means valid via online/offline flip

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?` to `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`, does `Auth::Session.from` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring? Close the question on SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.from`
- Entrypoint: `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`
- Attacker controls: an `is_online` value inconsistent with `associated_user`, since `@is_online` defaults to `!associated_user.nil?`
- Exploit idea: `expired?` and `refresh_token_expired?` treat missing expiry as never-expiring
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
