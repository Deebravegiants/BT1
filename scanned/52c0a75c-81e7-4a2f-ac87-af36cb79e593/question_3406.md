# Q3406: unified_admin? — normalisation happens after the decision via dotless name

## Question
Can a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input, supplied by an unprivileged attacker at the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`, make `ShopValidator.unified_admin?` and the code consuming its result disagree, given that the value returned is `uri.host`, not the fully normalised string the caller later interpolates? The binding to test is SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source; the impact to prove is Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/utils/shop_validator.rb` -> `ShopValidator.unified_admin?`
- Entrypoint: the unified-admin branch, entered whenever the first label of the parsed host is literally `admin`
- Attacker controls: a dotless shop name that takes the `name += ".#{myshopify_domain}"` branch only when `myshopify_domain` is present, yielding a different verdict for the same input
- Exploit idea: the value returned is `uri.host`, not the fully normalised string the caller later interpolates
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `sanitize!` raises `Errors::InvalidShopError` for the input; if it returns, print the value and diff it against the host in the recorded WebMock request
