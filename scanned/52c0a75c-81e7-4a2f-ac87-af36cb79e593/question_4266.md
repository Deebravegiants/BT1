# Q4266: get_path — query forwarded verbatim via attribute shadowing a method

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state` to `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids, does `Rest::Base.get_path` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached? Close the question on CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted and on Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/rest/base.rb` -> `Rest::Base.get_path`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Base.get_path(http_method:, operation:, entity:, ids:)`, which matches a path template and interpolates ids
- Attacker controls: a response key that collides with an existing method such as `session`, `client`, `id` or `original_state`
- Exploit idea: `params:` is passed through to the outgoing query with the merchant's token attached
- Invariant to test: CREDENTIAL DESTINATION: `client_secret`, the authorization `code` and `X-Shopify-Access-Token` leave only for a host `ShopValidator` accepted
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: minitest + WebMock: call a generated resource's `find` with an `ids` value containing `/` and assert the recorded request path
