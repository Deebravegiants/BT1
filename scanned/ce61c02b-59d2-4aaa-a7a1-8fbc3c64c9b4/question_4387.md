# Q4387: refresh_token_expired? — copy preserves the key via shop with separator

## Question
Trace `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?` from `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil with a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair: because `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant, does the value that was verified stop being the value that is used? Prove the break against SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source and map it to Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`).

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session#refresh_token_expired?`
- Entrypoint: `refresh_token_expired?`, which returns false whenever `@refresh_token_expires` is nil
- Attacker controls: a `shop` containing `_` so `"#{shop}_#{user_id}"` collides with another shop/user pair
- Exploit idea: `copy_attributes_from` overwrites the shop and token while keeping the id, so a key silently starts pointing at a different tenant
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - theft of a merchant's Admin API access token (`X-Shopify-Access-Token`) (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `expired?` is true, not false, for a session with no expiry once its token is past any plausible lifetime
