# Q1886: from — id and shop can disagree via associated_user id

## Question
If an unprivileged attacker submits the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id to `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`, does `Auth::Session.from` end up acting on a value that was never authenticated, because `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ? Close the question on AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right and on Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/auth/session.rb` -> `Auth::Session.from`
- Entrypoint: `Session.from(shop:, access_token_response:)`, which mints `"#{shop}_#{associated_user.id}"` or `"offline_#{shop}"`
- Attacker controls: the `associated_user.id` from the token response, interpolated into the session id
- Exploit idea: `id` is caller-controlled and never re-derived from `shop`, so the storage key and the shop it holds a token for can differ
- Invariant to test: AUTHORIZATION TRUTH: `covers?`, `expired?`, the `state` comparison and the proxy gate never answer permissively for a session lacking the right
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-user access inside one shop: one staff user's online session is served to another (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: assert `copy_attributes_from` refuses to change `shop` on a session whose `id` encodes a different shop
