# Q778: initialize — prefix re-rooting via query hash injection

## Question
Starting from `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch, can an unprivileged attacker supply a `query:` hash whose keys or values are user-controlled and are serialised by HTTParty into the outgoing query so that the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token? Determine whether SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source still holds through `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`, and whether the result reaches Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data.

## Target
- File/function: `lib/shopify_api/clients/rest/admin.rb` -> `Clients::Rest::Admin#initialize`
- Entrypoint: `Rest::Admin.new(session:, api_version:)`, including the `Context.rest_disabled` guard and the version-override branch
- Attacker controls: a `query:` hash whose keys or values are user-controlled and are serialised by HTTParty into the outgoing query
- Exploit idea: the `admin/` branch discards the versioned base path, so a caller-influenced path reaches a different API surface with the same token
- Invariant to test: SINGLE IDENTITY: exactly one shop identity exists per request, and every component derives it from the same authenticated source
- Expected Immunefi impact: Critical - cross-tenant access: one shop's request reads or mutates another merchant's data (this repo is covered by Shopify's HackerOne program per SECURITY.md; severity mapped to the equivalent Critical/High class)
- Fast validation: table-driven test over crafted `path` values asserting the final URI always begins with `#{base_uri}/admin/api/#{version}/`
